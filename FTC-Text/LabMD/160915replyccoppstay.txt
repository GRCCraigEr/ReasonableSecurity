INTRODUCTION
At a May 2014 hearing on a LabMD motion for preliminary injunction, the Honorable

William S. Duffey, Jr.,1 commented on the FTC investigation of LabMD, stating to FTC counsel:
“I could tell you as a result of that [2012] hearing [on the CID] that there was already a history of
acrimony and I think on behalf of the agency the exertion of authority in a mean-spirited way.”
LabMD MSD Reply, Ex. 1 at 47:17-21 (emphasis added)); see also id. 94:14-15 (stating to FTC
counsel: “I think that you will admit that there are no security standards from the FTC.”).
After learning that FTC was monitoring the website of LabMD CEO Michael Daugherty,2
Judge Duffey said: “This is taking an interesting and troubling turn which…[the Court] never
expected” due to “an admission by an FTC lawyer that they monitor blogs routinely of companies
for whatever purposes….” Id. 27:5-9. Judge Duffey described aspects of the FTC investigation of
LabMD “as almost being unconscionable.” Id. 77:9-10. Judge Duffey reached this conclusion
before it came to light that FTC’s case against LabMD was predicated on false evidence and
testimony relating to the 1718 File. See ID 6-11, 88; IDF 100-168. “The ALJ [subsequently]
found…that after the meeting between Tiversa and FTC staff in the fall of 2009, Mr. Boback
directed Mr. Wallace to generate false information purporting to show that the 1718 file had spread

Alarm bells began going off in the corridors of FTC’s Division of Privacy and Identity Protection
when Mr. Daugherty’s website previewed his soon-to-be-published book, The Devil Inside the
Beltway, in July 2013. “Three days after Mr. Daugherty posted the [book] trailer online,…FTC
gave notice of its intent to file a complaint against LabMD.” LabMD, Inc. v. FTC, 776 F.3d 1275,
1277 (11th Cir. 2015). The book was critical of FTC’s gestapo tactics in pursuing LabMD
generally, and particularly singled out misconduct on the part of CC Alain Sheer and Ruth
Yodaikan. Mr. Sheer’s draconian obsession with destroying LabMD culminated in his
importuning Tiversa to provide fraudulent evidence of “spread” regarding the 1718 File. It is a
cautionary tale of agency retaliation and misconduct when confronted by a citizen who refused to
capitulate to agency overregulation and malfeasance.

PUBLIC
to multiple locations on the Internet….” Op. 32 n.84; see Op. 31 (Boback’s claims of “spread” are
“false”).
In an exercise of judicial restraint, Judge Duffey (and later the Eleventh Circuit) declined
to address the legality of FTC’s actions to allow it to further consider those actions before it would
need to defend its conduct in federal Court. See generally LabMD, Inc. v. FTC, 776 F.3d 1275
(11th Cir. 2015).
Judge Duffey further found that “there is significant merit to…[LabMD’s] argument that
Section 5 does not justify an investigation into data security practices and consumer privacy
issues[.]” FTC v. LabMD, No. 1:12-cv-3005-WSD, Dkt. No. 23, at 14 (N.D. Ga. 2012). Cf. FTC
v. AT&T Mobility, No. 15-16585, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 15913, *24-25 (9th Cir. Aug. 29, 2016)
(rejecting FTC’s claimed Section 5 jurisdiction over entities regulated by FCC).
In November 2015, the Initial Decision authored by FTC Chief Administrative Law Judge
D. Michael Chappell dismissed the FTC complaint against LabMD in its entirety for lack of
evidence of harm, ID 88, rejecting in great detail Tiversa’s false evidence and perjured testimony,
see ID 7-11; IDF 100-168.
Three years earlier, FTC Commissioner J. Thomas Rosch warned the Commission to avoid
reliance on the 1718 File (the sole basis for the Commission Opinion’s conclusion that LabMD’s
alleged data-security practices harmed or likely harmed consumers, see Op. 17-25) as “evidence”
in this case: “[T]he Commission should avoid even the appearance of bias or impropriety by not
relying on such evidence or information [i.e., the 1718 File] in this investigation.” Rosch Dissent
at 2 (emphasis added).
Nonetheless, rather than prosecuting Tiversa for unfair-and-deceptive trade practices, 15
U.S.C. § 45(a); see RX644, the Commission ignored these red flags, choosing instead to reverse

2

PUBLIC
the Initial Decision dismissing the complaint. It did this even though the Commission Opinion
acknowledges that after a meeting between Tiversa representatives and lead CC Alain Sheer and
other FTC staff, Tiversa created false evidence for use by Mr. Sheer, Op. 31-32 & n.84;3 there is
no evidence that any identifiable consumer has been harmed by Tiversa’s 2008 theft of the 1718
File or LabMD’s alleged data-security practices, long-since discontinued, see Op. 17,36; ID 52,88;
IDCOL 18; and LabMD is out of business, “with a computer that is shut down and not connected
to the Internet,” Op. 36.
As CC’s Opposition confirms, the Commission Opinion and Final Order are ultra vires,
unconstitutional, unsupported by evidence, and contrary to law, serving only three (prohibited)
purposes: first, to retaliate against LabMD for its CEO’s decision to exercise his First Amendment
right to publicly criticize FTC; second, to give FTC that which, by its own admission,4 Congress
refused to give it—new nationwide data-security “unfairness unreasonableness” civil-penalty
powers under 15 U.S.C. § 45(m)(1)(B) to wield against all U.S. businesses; and third, to give FTC
a new “tool” to attempt to demand Chevron deference in pursuit of its unilateral extra-statutory
“expansion” of its “unfairness” powers.5
Unless the Commission fully grants LabMD’s stay application or otherwise dismisses this
case, a Court of Appeals will be forced to address the Commission’s decision to give itself new
national data-security civil penalty powers (which Congress intentionally and specifically denied),

3

Tiversa’s false evidence formed the basis for FTC’s in-house prosecution of LabMD, see SA 47 & nn.6-7; IDF 100-168, as Mr. Sheer made clear in his opening statement, Tr. 16-17,31.

See Prepared Statement of the FTC, Privacy in the Digital Age: Preventing Data Breaches and
Combating Cybercrime, Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, at 11 (Feb. 4, 2014);

5

FTC has tried this before without success. See LabMD, Inc., 776 F.3d at 1278-79 (rebuffing FTC
deference demands).
3

PUBLIC
while also punishing LabMD for speaking out and criticizing FTC, all on an emergency briefing
schedule. Because LabMD has satisfied all four stay factors, there is no reason why an Article III
Court should be forced to address the issues of national importance presented by this case on such
an expedited basis.
II.

UNADDRESSED AND UNDISPUTED MATTERS
Generally, an opposition must address arguments and factual assertions to avoid conceding

points. See CREW v. Cheney, 593 F. Supp. 2d 194, 229 (D.D.C. 2009)(“failure to respond to an
argument…acts as a concession”); see, e.g., DeVito v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., No.02-CV0745, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27374, *13 (N.D.N.Y Nov. 29, 2004).
Here, CC offers no response to most of LabMD’s arguments and facts. Instead, in an
apparent attempt to avoid application of this principle to its Opposition, CC states in a footnote:
“In addressing only the relevant facts and issues, Complaint Counsel does not concede any of the
irrelevant factual assertions made by Respondent.” Op. 2 n.1. CC should not be allowed to avoid
substantively responding to LabMD’s arguments and factual assertions through this disclaimer.
In any event, LabMD’s Stay Application and supporting materials—and CC’s failure to
rebut or challenge LabMD’s factual assertions and address LabMD’s arguments—speak for
themselves. And a federal Court will ultimately decide for itself what facts and issues are relevant.
III.

CC’S OPPOSITION CONFIRMS ALL STAY FACTORS FAVOR LabMD
A. LABMD LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON MERITS
1. Stay Warranted Due to Complex Record and Important Issues
There is no dispute that “[t]he Commission may…grant a stay if the case presents the

application of difficult legal questions to a complex factual record….” SO 7 n.8. “Complaint
Counsel agrees…this case involves an extensive and complex record and presents important

4

PUBLIC
issues.” SO 7-8 n.8. The Commission has also recognized this. See SA 9-11. As demonstrated
by LabMD’s stay application, SA 1-24, the issues here are far more complex than those in ECM
Biofilms (unaddressed by CC), where this Commission granted a full stay. See In the Matter of
ECM Biofilms, Inc., No. 9358, at 1-2 (Dec. 8, 2015).
This case involves the application of difficult legal questions, as well as legal questions on
which a wide range of reasonable jurists (and legal scholars) have disagreed with the positions set
forth in the Commission Opinion. See, e.g., FTC v. LabMD, No. 1:12-cv-3005-WSD, Dkt. No.
23, at 14 (N.D. Ga. 2012)(“Court finds there is significant merit to…[LabMD’s] argument that
Section 5 does not justify an investigation into data security practices and consumer privacy
issues[.]”); ID 88 (LabMD’s “alleged unreasonable data security cannot properly be
declared…unfair….[T]he Complaint must be DISMISSED.”); Gus Horowitz, Data Security and
the FTC’s UnCommon Law, 101 IOWA L. REV. 955, 958-59 (2016). Cf. FTC v. Wyndham
Worldwide Corp., 10 F. Supp. 3d 602, 634 (D. N.J. 2014)(“[S]tatutory authority and fair-notice
challenges [to FTC “unfairness” data-security regulation] confront this Court with novel, complex
statutory interpretation issues that give rise to a substantial ground for difference of opinion.”).
For this reason alone, the first stay factor is met. See SA 9-12.
2. Stay Also Warranted Because LabMD Likely to Succeed on Appeal
i.

CC Misunderstands Stay Standard

CC suggests LabMD must make a “strong showing on the merits,” arguing LabMD has not
done so because it is only “recycling” arguments the Commission already rejected and expressing
“mere disagreement” with the Commission. SO 5. Not so.
In the administrative context, “likelihood of success” is not measured by whether the
Commission believes the respondent likely to succeed on appeal. The stay standard does not

5

PUBLIC
require that the Commission admit decisional error. In the Matter of Novartis, 128 F.T.C. 233,
1999 FTC LEXIS 211, *2-5 (1999); see also Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Com. v.
Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843-44 (D.C. Cir. 1977).
CC’s reliance on Daniel Chapter One, SO 5, 13, should be rejected on the facts and law.
First, Daniel Chapter One states: “[T]he Commission need not harbor doubt about its decision in
order to grant the stay. Respondents…may satisfy the ‘merits’ factor if their argument on at least
one claim is ‘substantial’—so long as the other three factors weigh in their favor.” 2010 FTC
LEXIS 23, *6 (2010)(citations and quotation marks omitted). Second, Daniel Chapter One is
factually inapposite, as it involved routine deception claims and, unlike here, the Commission
“affirm[ed] the Initial Decision…both as a matter of fact and…law.” Daniel Chapter One, 2009
FTC LEXIS 259, *1 (Dec. 24, 2009).
Regardless, for the reasons set forth in its Stay Application, LabMD has independently
satisfied the first stay factor even under CC’s manufactured standard.
ii.

CC’s Failure to Respond to LabMD Arguments

As discussed above, CC did not substantively respond to many of LabMD’s merits
arguments, thereby conceding those points, notwithstanding its footnote disclaimer. See SO 2 n.1.
Among other things, CC did not substantively address the following LabMD arguments:


FTC lacks “unfairness” data-security jurisdiction, and its actions against LabMD are
ultra vires. Cf. SA 12-13.



FTC violations of LabMD’s due process rights for failure to give fair notice. Cf. SA
12-14, 18.



FTC abused its discretion by prosecuting LabMD in-house in an attempt to, inter alia,
advance FTC’s national policy goals. Cf. SA 14.

6

PUBLIC


Commission Opinion misinterpreted plain language of Section 5(n) and violated
Section 5(n)’s prohibition against primary reliance on putative “public policy”
evidence to prove harm. Cf. SA 14-15.



FTC failure to establish constitutionally required objective-medical-industry-practice
standard of care and deviations therefrom at specific points in time. Cf. SA 16-18.



Commission Opinion wrongfully rejected Initial Decision’s conclusion that CC failed
to meet its burden of proof even under CC’s claimed “significant risk” standard. Cf.
SA 16.



The Commission Opinion wrongfully relied on ex parte, uncross-examined statements
for the truth of the matters asserted. Cf. SA 16.



The Commission Opinion’s misapplication of HIPAA standards unsupported by any
expert testimony (which it was CC’s burden to adduce), contrary to the Complaint, the
Commission’s prior Orders, and CC’s representations. Cf. SA 17-19.



Commission Opinion’s wrongful rejection of the Initial Decision’s determination that
CC’s harm experts’ reports and testimony were not entitled to weight, speculative, and
based on fabricated evidence and perjured testimony. Cf. SA 19-20.



FTC’s relationship with Tiversa and use of 1718 File in the LabMD prosecution
violates the Fourth Amendment. Cf. SA 20.



The Commission Opinion’s cost-benefit analysis is fatally flawed. Cf. SA 20-21.



The Order is invalid because it relates to alleged acts or practices occurring many years
ago, long-since discontinued, which will never reoccur. Cf. SA 23-24.



FTC’s retaliatory issuance of the LabMD complaint violates 15 U.S.C. § 45(b) and
LabMD’s First Amendment rights. Cf. SA 24.

7

PUBLIC


FTC’s in-house administrative process is unconstitutional. Cf. SA 24-25.

CC’s silence speaks for itself. Because CC “did not bother to respond” to LabMD’s
arguments, it conceded the points. See, e.g., DeVito, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27374, at *13.
iii.

CC’s Limited Substantive Responses to LabMD’s Arguments Fail
on Facts and Law

CC’s reliance on POM Wonderful to claim that a federal Court should defer to the
Commission’s rejection of the Initial Decision fails. See SO 5. POM Wonderful is a deceptivepractices case where the Commission affirmed the ALJ’s findings on liability. 777 F.3d 478, 489
(D.C. Cir. 2015). Here, the Commission reversed the Initial Decision dismissing the complaint,
and thus the reviewing Court “may…examine…FTC’s findings more closely[.]” Schering-Plough
Corp. v. FTC, 402 F.3d 1056, 1062 (11th Cir. 2005)(vacating Commission decision).
Next, CC’s repetition of the Commission Opinion’s defense of the Order, SO 6, fails for
the reasons set forth in LabMD’s stay application, see SA 21-24, 27-29. The Commission may
have some “discretion” to fashion a “cease and desist” order, but it did not issue a “cease and
desist” order here. Therefore, the Order exceeds the Commission’s authority.
CC does not state why it did not bring an action in federal Court under Section 13(b) of the
FTC Act if it wanted additional (or expedited) relief. But whatever its rationale, the Commission
cannot change or ignore the text of 15 U.S.C. § 45(b), which only allows it to order LabMD to
stop doing something—and does not allow the Commission to require LabMD to affirmatively
perform expensive, time-consuming, and burdensome tasks.
CC’s attempt to distinguish Heater, SO 6-7, is also in error. The principles set forth in
Heater extend beyond monetary redress to bar FTC from including HITECH notification

8

PUBLIC
provisions in “cease and desist” orders.6 See AMREP Corp. v. FTC, 475 U.S. 1034, 1035 (1986)
(White, J., dissenting from denial of cert.) (noting “decisions of the Fourth and Ninth Circuits
holding that § 5 authorizes only cease-and-desist orders, and not notification orders”).
Finally, CC’s admission that HITECH notification requirements applied “since 2010,” SO
13-14, further confirms that Part III of the Order forces LabMD to retroactively comply with
notification obligations it might have had after 2010 under HITECH—a statute FTC does not
enforce (and has not accused LabMD of violating), SA 22-23 & n.30—enforced by a different
agency, HHS, which declined to prosecute LabMD for Tiversa’s theft of the 1718 File in 2008,
even though CC’s own privilege log shows it reached out repeatedly over a period of 3 years to
HHS regarding LabMD. See CC Privilege Log.
iv.

CC’s Efforts to Shield FTC’s Actions From Judicial Scrutiny Fail

CC also invokes procedural technicalities in an effort to shield FTC’s actions from judicial
scrutiny, suggesting that issue-waiver principles bar LabMD from making its case on the merits.
See SO 6-7, 13 & nn.5-7. That argument fails for at least three reasons.
First, LabMD’s stay application itself is sufficient to preserve all issues raised therein and
in supporting materials,7 see Busse Broadcasting Corp. v. FCC, 87 F.3d 1456, 1461 (D.C. Cir.
1996), particularly because FTC has been given yet another opportunity to vacate its Opinion and
Order. See 16 C.F.R. § 3.72(a); 15 U.S.C. § 45(b). See generally SA (explaining why FTC’s
actions are unlawful). FTC cannot later complain that it was not on notice of LabMD’s arguments.

6

Part III is fundamentally different from affirmative disclosures and corrective advertising in
deception cases.
7

Rule 3.51(b), 16 C.F.R. § 3.51(b), does not apply here because LabMD does not object to the
Initial Decision dismissing the Complaint. CC apparently agrees. See CC Opposition to LabMD
Cross-Motion to Strike at 2; CC Motion to Enforce Briefing Limits at 4 & n.3 (arguing that crossappeals based on absence of factual and legal rulings are not allowed).
9

PUBLIC
See Getty Oil Co. v. Andrus, 607 F.2d 253, 255-56 (9th Cir. 1979); Chrysler Corp. v. FTC, 561
F.2d 357, 364 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1977).
Second, CC’s reliance on the Commission Opinion to claim waiver fails. The Commission
Opinion’s reliance on United States v. Jernigan, 341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n.8 (11th Cir. 2003), see Op.
33, is badly misplaced. The issue-waiver principles in Jernigan apply only to appellants (here,
CC because the Initial Decision dismissed the Complaint), requiring that issues be raised in the
appellant’s opening brief. See Jernigan, 341 F.3d at 1283 n.8. The reason for that rule is
procedural fairness to the appellee (here, LabMD). See id. (“‘[A]n appellee is entitled to rely on
the content of an appellant’s brief for the scope of the issues appealed.”’ (citations omitted).
There is no fairness for LabMD here, for had the Commission applied the Jernigan
principles to CC’s appeal brief, it would have dismissed the case because CC declined to brief
necessary elements of any Section 5 “unfairness” violation, which the Commission reached
anyway, finding against LabMD (then claiming it was LabMD that did not dispute these issues).8
See CCAB 1 n.1 (footnote declining to brief second prongs of Section 5(n)); Op. 25-27 (holding
second two prongs of Section 5(n) met and stating that “LabMD has not disputed Complaint
Counsel’s showing as to the availability and cost of these alternatives”).9
Worse yet, the Commission doubled-down on its error by barring LabMD from filing a
protective conditional cross-appeal and thus denied LabMD the opportunity even to file an opening

8

CC’s Opposition recycles this claim, SO 3-4, notwithstanding CC’s failure to brief these issues
on appeal.
9

LabMD has no obligation to raise any issues in an optional Rule 3.55 reconsideration petition,
just as a party is not required to file a FRAP 40 petition for panel rehearing to preserve issues for
Supreme Court review. See 61 Fed. Reg. 50,640, 50,645 (Sept. 26, 1996)(Rule 3.55 deadline
shortened to 14 days to track FRAP 40).
10

PUBLIC
brief as a cross-appellant (without warning LabMD of its misinterpretation of Jernigan).10 See
December 18 Order at 2 (“Respondent may not file an opening appeal brief[.]”).

If the

Commission interprets its Rules or Orders in this case to in any way cut off or limit LabMD’s
appeal rights, it will violate LabMD’s due process rights—yet again—for failure to give fair notice
of its extra-textual interpretations.11 See, e.g., Satellite Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 824 F.2d 1, 3-4

Third, the Commission is aware of LabMD’s constitutional and statutory objections,
including but not limited to LabMD’s First Amendment retaliation claim. See LabMD, Inc. v.

(discussing statutory and constitutional claims raised by LabMD in three collateral federal court
actions seeking to enjoin FTC prosecution). A Court of Appeals may now address the merits of
those claims and grant LabMD additional discovery to further develop its First and Fourth
Amendment arguments.12 15 U.S.C. § 45(c); FTC v. Std. Oil Co., 449 U.S. 232, 244-46 (1980).

B. STAY NECESSARY TO PREVENT IRREPARABLE HARM TO LABMD
1. Unpayable and Unrecoverable Compliance Costs
CC does not deny that the Order will force LabMD to incur unrecoverable monetary and
time costs. Cf. SO 10-12. Nor does CC deny that such costs are irreparable harm. Instead, CC
claims that such costs are not sufficiently “substantial” and that, in its view, LabMD did not
provide sufficient evidence and precise quantification of such costs. See SO 9-12. Those claims
are contrary to fact and law.
CC argues that “the Commission has denied stays in other cases in which notification
provisions would have imposed similar, de minimis costs,” relying on In re N. Tex. Specialty
Physicians (“NTSP”), 141 F.T.C. 456 (Jan. 20, 2006). SO 11-12. If anything, NTSP supports
LabMD’s argument that the unrecoverable time-and-monetary costs associated with notifying
around 9,300 people and their insurance companies irreparably harms LabMD:
While NTSP cites California Dental, 1996 FTC LEXIS 277, as support…, that
reliance is misplaced, because in California Dental the respondent would have had
to notify, and potentially renotify, up to 19,000 member dentists. By contrast, in
this case, NTSP will have to notify, and potentially renotify, only approximately
400 member physicians, and a limited number of payors in a limited geographic
region. Thus, the burden and expense involved in implementing the notice
provisions in the two cases are not facially comparable.
NTSP, 141 F.T.C. at 465-66 (emphasis added). Here, unlike NTSP, which involved notification
targeting roughly 400 dentists, LabMD will be required to send roughly 10,000 letters—about
twenty times more notification letters than NTSP.
CC’s reliance on dicta from Kentucky Household Goods to suggest LabMD has not offered
sufficient evidence of irreparable harm, SO 8, fails because it is untethered from facts. Unlike
here, see Daugherty Decl.; SA 5,25-26, Kentucky Household Goods claimed irreparable harm

12

PUBLIC
without citation or supporting declaration. See KHG SA 7-8. Cf. Cal. Dental Ass’n, 1996 FTC
LEXIS 227, *6-7 (supporting affidavit established irreparable harm).
CC also claims LabMD must precisely quantify its unrecoverable and unpayable
compliance costs. See SO 9-12. Not so.
First, contra CC, see SO 9, it is not the amount of the compliance cost but the fact that such
costs are unrecoverable due to sovereign immunity that renders these costs irreparably harmful.
See, e.g., Chamber of Commerce v. Edmondson, 594 F.3d 742, 756, 770-71 (10th Cir. 2010)
(approximately $1,000-per-business-per-year compliance costs cause irreparable harm because
such costs are unrecoverable due to sovereign immunity).
Second, LabMD cannot precisely quantify the amount of money the Order would require
it to spend because LabMD does not know what the Order requires LabMD to do, cf. RX532 (FTC
testimony showing lack of data-security standards), because the Order is unconstitutionally vague,
see SA 21-24, 26-29. Also, the Commission Opinion does not address at all what FTC thinks a
“reasonable” “comprehensive information security program” for LabMD would require now that
LabMD is out of business, except to say it would be different from what FTC apparently thinks
LabMD should have had when it was operational. See Op. 36 (“[R]easonable and appropriate
information security program for LabMD’s current operations…will undoubtedly differ from an
appropriate comprehensive information security program if LabMD resumes more active
operations.” (emphasis added)). Indeed, FTC’s sole expert on “reasonable” data-security limited
her opinions to between 2005 and July 2010, i.e., when LabMD was operational. ID 87 n.45;
RX0532 at 203:15-19 (Hill is sole source of standards).
CC’s bald assertion that the Commission should not credit LabMD’s insolvency, SO 8, is
contrary to reality, particularly because CC does not dispute the current state of LabMD’s business,

13

PUBLIC
cf. SO 10-11, 14. Notwithstanding that LabMD amply met its burden of establishing irreparable
harm in its Stay Application, LabMD has attached to this Reply a supplemental declaration
providing additional factual evidence regarding the time-and-monetary costs associated with the
Final Order. See Supp. Daugherty Decl. & Ex. A.
2. FTC Violations of LabMD’s Constitutional Rights
CC does not address LabMD’s argument that the Final Order will violate LabMD’s
procedural due process rights by permanently depriving it of property before a meaningful hearing.
Cf. SA 26-27. And CC does not deny that violation of constitutional rights is irreparable harm.
Instead, they essentially argue that because the Commission has already rejected LabMD’s
constitutional claims, LabMD’s constitutional rights will not be violated. See SO 12-13.
Complaint Counsel’s dog won’t hunt. The Commission, which describes itself as “mainly
a law enforcement agency,”13 cannot be the arbiter of whether the Commission has respected
LabMD’s constitutional rights for the same reason a police officer cannot ultimately decide
whether a challenged search violates a criminal defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights. FTC is not
a Court nor its equal on interpreting the federal Constitution, and lacks expertise necessary to
decide constitutional questions. See Hill v. SEC, No. 15-12831, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 10946,
*38-40 (11th Cir. 2016) (recognizing lack of administrative-agency expertise to adjudicate
constitutional claims); see also Yellow Taxi Co. v. NLRB, 721 F.2d 366, 382 (D.C. Cir. 1983).
Irreparable harm to LabMD should be assessed assuming the correctness of LabMD’s position, cf.
Barnes v. E-Systems, 501 U.S. 1301, 1302 (1991)(Scalia, J., in Chambers), a fortiori because

LabMD’s constitutional claims “fall[] outside the area generally entrusted to the agency…,
i.e.,…the constitutional law.” Hi-Craft Clothing Co. v. NLRB, 660 F.2d 910, 914-15 (3d Cir.
1981); see NMA v. Sec’y of Labor, 153 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 1998).
Therefore, FTC must recognize that LabMD’s constitutional objections are meritorious and
thus constitute irreparable harm.
3. Reputational Harm
CC does not deny that reputational harm is sufficient to support a stay, instead arguing
(without citation) that because LabMD is no longer in business, it cannot suffer reputational harm.
See SO 14. However, reputational harm can be irreparable even if no business is lost. See, e.g.,
Kroupa v. Nielsen, 731 F.3d 813, 820-21 (8th Cir. 2013)(banishment from 4-H clubs due to alleged
cheating at State Fair is irreparable reputational harm). Accordingly, CC’s argument again fails.
C. BALANCE-OF-HARMS AND PUBLIC INTEREST TIP SHARPLY IN FAVOR OF STAY
CC’s Opposition confirms that the final stay factors tip sharply in favor of protecting
LabMD, and the public, from the Commission Opinion and Order pending review.
CC does not dispute the absence of any evidence that any identifiable consumer has been
harmed by LabMD’s alleged data-security practices many years ago, long-since discontinued. See
SO 10-11, 14-16.
Instead, CC focuses on alleged amorphous privacy harms they claim occurred as a result
of Tiversa’s theft of the 1718 File in early 2008, and its alleged “availability” on Limewire, which
ended no later than May 2008 according to them, Compl. ¶ 20, and a conclusory assertion that
LabMD “continues to preserve tissue samples, provide past test results to healthcare providers,
and maintain the personal data of 750,000 people on its computer system.” SO 14-17.

15

PUBLIC
This argument is another dog with different fleas. CC here engages in bald speculation
supported solely by the Commission Opinion’s ipse dixit. The fact that courts routinely conclude
that claims of injury based on alleged risk-of-identity-theft or “privacy” harms do not rise to the
identifiable trifle of an injury-in-fact necessary to sue, see, e.g., Khan v. Children’s Nat’l Health
Sys., No. TDC-15-2125, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66404, *7-22 (D.Md. May 18, 2016); Cox v.
Valley Hope Ass’n, No. 2:16-cv-04127-NKL, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119663 (W.D. Mo. Sept. 6,
2016) (rejecting “risk of harm” and “privacy/embarrassment” theories of injury under Article III
in healthcare data-breach context), underscores why CC’s speculation cannot change the absence
of any evidence of actual harm to anyone caused by LabMD’s allegedly “unreasonable” data
security. See ID 52, 88; IDCOL 18.
CC acknowledges that “the 9,300 consumers [listed on the 1718 File] have gone without
notification…for eight years.”14 SO 16. FTC’s inaction and sloth refute CC’s claimed urgency.
They do not deny that if FTC felt LabMD’s alleged data-security practices between 2005 and 2010
posed a time-sensitive public threat, it could have sought temporary relief in federal Court pursuant
to Section 13(b) of the FTC Act. Cf. SO 16. CC received the 1718 File from Tiversa through the
Privacy Institute in 2009. IDF 136-138. CC did not recommend issuance of the administrative
complaint until July 2013 (three days after LabMD publicly criticized FTC). LabMD, Inc., 776
F.3d at 1277. If FTC believed notification time-sensitive and necessary to protect consumers, and
the time-and-monetary costs are “de minimis,” FTC would have notified the people listed on the
1718 File many years ago. It did not. Neither it nor any of its experts have “notified” or otherwise

14

CC cannot rely on ECM Biofilms and Jerk, LLC, to support its notification demands, SO 16,
because both are deception cases, which did not involve “notification” provisions resembling Part
III of the Final Order. Ironically, the Commission fully granted ECM Biofilm’s stay application.
16

PUBLIC
contacted even a single person listed therein at any point. FTC’s actions contradict CC’s claimed
view that notification is time-sensitive.
Likewise, CC’s claim that “[t]he harm or likelihood of harm to the 9,300 consumers [listed
in the 1718 File] increases every day,” SO 15, should be rejected because it is belied by the facts
developed through CC’s own multi-year investigation. “[T]he evidence fails to show that the 1718
File was in fact downloaded by anyone other than Tiversa, who obtained the document in February
2008.” ID 60. The record is devoid of any evidence that even a single identifiable “consumer” has
suffered any harm due to Tiversa’s theft or LabMD’s alleged data-security practices, “even after
the passage of many years.” ID 52. In any event, the Commission may grant a stay even where,
unlike here, “there is some potential for ongoing harm to consumers[.]” N.C. Bd. of Dental
Examiners, No. 9343, 2012 FTC LEXIS 28, *16 (Feb. 12, 2012).
CC’s argument that LabMD’s declaration does not describe material changes to its
business, SO 16, fails. The Commission Opinion justified its Order, in part, on the ground that
LabMD “may resume operations at some future time[.]” Op. 36. LabMD’s declaration definitively
closes the door on that possibility. Daugherty Decl. ¶¶ 14-16, 19-20. CC does not dispute that
LabMD “does not expect ever to resume operations and does not see how that could ever happen.”
See SO 11.
CC’s claim that LabMD is still using alleged data-security practices the Commission found
“unreasonable,” SO 17, strains credulity. The Commission assessed LabMD’s data-security
practices when LabMD was an ongoing cancer-detection business with numerous employees
(principally between 2005 and 2010), properly describing its alleged practices in the past tense.
See Op. 11-25. The Commission Opinion recognizes that LabMD is now closed “with a computer
that is shut down and not connected to the Internet.” Op. 36. The only FTC data-security

17

PUBLIC
“unreasonableness” expert did not offer any opinions beyond July 2010—over six years ago. ID
87 n.45.
CC does not dispute that LabMD’s computers are turned off and not connected to the
Internet, see SO 10-11,16, and even CC’s data-security expert testified that LabMD’s physical
security was adequate. Tr. 293:3-7 (“Q.…[I]t’s your opinion that LabMD’s physical security was
adequate; is that correct? [Hill] A. Yes. As far as providing locks to server rooms and access to
their—physical access to their computers, yes.”). If anything, LabMD’s “physical security” has
improved. Daugherty Decl. ¶ 11. And the FTC Complaint solely challenged “LabMD’s computer
security practices.” Op. 25.
CC does not deny that it is in the public interest to restrain FTC from violating the
Constitution and exceeding its authority, or that a federal court has already found that there is
significant merit to LabMD’s argument that FTC is improperly expanding its powers here. See
FTC v. LabMD, No. 1:12-cv-3005-WSD, Dkt. No. 23, at 14 (N.D. Ga. 2012); SA 30-31. Instead,
CC argues that “[t]here is no public interest in restraining agencies from fulfilling their duties while
respondents challenge their authority with arguments…unlikely to succeed.” SO 17. Here, FTC
is not fulfilling its duties; it is violating the law. See SA 12-24.
Worse, the Commission Opinion and Final Order have national effects that radiate far
beyond LabMD. Every U.S. business that uses computers has an interest in a full stay. Absent
this, FTC will have obtained that which Congress refused to give it by FTC’s own admission
through its administrative prosecution of LabMD:15 new data-security civil-penalty powers on a
national scale. See 15 U.S.C. § 45(m)(1)(B). This is not an overstatement. Without a stay, FTC

will be able to use the Commission Opinion and Order to threaten any U.S. business at any time
(even without a breach, with or without evidence of actual harm) with massive civil penalties
unless they do what FTC says. See FTC v. Sears, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12619, *1-2 (D. Colo.
1983); Audubon Life Ins.. v. FTC, 543 F. Supp. 1362, 1363 (M.D. La. 1982); U.S. v. Braswell,
Inc., 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15444, *5 (N.D. Ga. 1981).
Absent a full stay, FTC will have this new data-security civil-penalty power even before
a single federal court addresses the legality of the Commission’s Opinion and Order. This is
contrary to the public interest. Instead, the strong public interest in enforcing Congress’s decision
to “rein in” FTC through Section 5(n) to protect the public from FTC tips sharply in favor of a
stay.16 S. Div. First Premier Bank v. CFPB, 819 F. Supp. 2d 906, 922 (D. S.D. 2011). The Order
and Opinion must be stayed.
CONCLUSION
For these reasons, LabMD respectfully requests that the Commission GRANT its
Application in full or otherwise dismiss this case.

(1984). Plaintiff invokes that assertion to urge that the order must therefore be final
action reviewable under the APA. See LabMD Br. 19-20.
Plaintiff gets matters backwards. The denial of a motion to dismiss is
unquestionably interlocutory and non-final. The question posed by plaintiff’s
argument is whether the District Court for the District of New Jersey could properly
accord Chevron deference to a non-final order. The court in that case found it
unnecessary to reach the question, ruling for the Commission without reaching the
issue of deference. See Wyndham Worldwide, 2014 WL 1349019, at *9 n.8. Whether the
denial of the motion to dismiss is properly accorded deference is not, of course, an
issue before this Court. And the answer to that question has no bearing on the finality
of the Commission’s order.
B.

The district court lacked jurisdiction over LabMD’s constitutional
claims, as well as its statutory claims.
1. LabMD’s first amendment and due process claims, like its challenges to the

FTC’s statutory authority, are properly considered as part of judicial review following
an adverse decision by the FTC. See Thunder Basin at 215; supra 12-13.8

LabMD’s citation to pre-enforcement first amendment cases misses the mark.
See, e.g., Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, No. 13-193, 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2334
(June 16, 2014); Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 302 n.13, 99
S. Ct. 2301, 2311 n. 13 (1979). Susan B. Anthony did not involve whether a district
court had jurisdiction over a challenge to non-final agency action, but rather whether
the plaintiff had standing to challenge a law prior to its enforcement. In relevant part,
Babbitt concerned the possibility of an order prohibiting certain speech. There was no

have been satisfied. LabMD, however, asks this Court to assume ex ante that the
Commission will fail to be a fair decisionmaker and on that basis to halt ongoing
administrative proceedings. LabMD Br. 34-35. LabMD has cited no authority for such
an extraordinary request.
2. This Court may also affirm the district court’s decision on the alternative
ground that LabMD has failed to state any valid constitutional claims. See Lucas v.
W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir. 2001) (noting that this Court may
affirm a district court judgment on any basis disclosed by the record).
a. First, LabMD has failed to move its first amendment claims “across the line
from conceivable to plausible.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.
Ct. 1955, 1974 (2007). Agency officials are entitled to a presumption “that they have
properly discharged their official duties.” United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 46364, 116 S. Ct. 1480, 1485-1486 (1996) (quoting United States v. Chemical Foundation, 272
U.S. 1, 14-15, 47 S. Ct. 1, 6 (1926)). And LabMD has not plausibly alleged that the
FTC conduct at issue “adversely affected the protected speech,” or that “there is a
causal connection between the [FTC’s purportedly] retaliatory actions and the adverse
effect on speech.” Moton v. Cowart, 631 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir. 2011) (quotation
omitted).
The Court cannot plausibly infer a causal nexus between Mr. Daugherty’s first
amendment activity—his public criticism of the FTC in his published book and in
other public statements—and the FTC actions LabMD challenges in this lawsuit. Mr.

20

Daugherty’s criticism began after the investigation was well underway; indeed, the
entire premise of LabMD’s public critique is that the agency’s investigation of LabMD
was itself unfair or improper. The public complaints of a target of an agency
enforcement action do not render any subsequent pursuit of the action
unconstitutional, as LabMD urges. And Mr. Daugherty was not singled out for
enforcement: FTC has brought other enforcement actions against firms across the
country alleging unfair acts or practices in connection with data security. R1-3, at 9
n.12.
LabMD’s reliance on the fact that Mr. Daugherty’s publication of his book
occurred at roughly the same time as the filing of the administrative complaint cannot
withstand scrutiny. LabMD Br. 15. Mr. Daugherty’s book was published
approximately three years after the FTC began investigating LabMD. See R1, ¶ 26.
Courts have correctly declined to infer retaliation unless the timing is “unusually
suggestive.” Lauren ex rel. Jean v. DeFlaminis, 480 F.3d 259, 267 (3d Cir. 2007)); see also
Swanson v. Gen. Servs Admin., 110 F.3d 1180, 1188 (5th Cir. 1997) (timing must be
“close” to support inference of retaliation). A causal connection cannot plausibly be
inferred from timing when the allegedly protected speech occurs in the middle of an
ongoing action. See Slattery v. Swiss Reinsurance Am. Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir. 2001)
(“[Where] gradual adverse job actions began well before the plaintiff had ever engaged
in any protected [first amendment] activity, an inference of retaliation does not
arise.”).

Moreover, nothing in the FTC administrative complaint challenges anything
LabMD or Mr. Daugherty said or expressed, and a cease-and-desist order connected
to data security practices would not restrict their expression in the future. And there is
no basis for a contention that the enforcement action had a “chilling” effect on
protected speech; such an assertion cannot be squared with the reality that LabMD
and Mr. Daugherty have continued to engage in public criticism of the FTC
throughout the proceeding.
b. LabMD’s due process claim regarding fair notice may also be dismissed for
failure to state a claim. LabMD incorrectly contends that due process requires the
FTC to issue data security regulations before bringing an enforcement action against
LabMD. See R1, ¶ 128; LabMD Br. 31. But the Supreme Court has long rejected this
position, explaining instead that problems may arise that require case-by-case
adjudication, and that agencies “retain power to deal with the problems on a case-tocase basis if the administrative process is to be effective.” SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332
U.S. 194, 202-03, 67 S. Ct. 1575, 1580-1581 (1947). As the Supreme Court has
explained, “the proscriptions in § 5 are flexible, to be defined with particularity by the
myriad of cases from the field of business, . . . [which] necessarily give[] the
Commission an influential role in interpreting § 5 and in applying it to the facts of
particular cases arising out of unprecedented situations.” FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive Co.,
380 U.S. 374, 384-85, 85 S. Ct. 1035, 1042 (1965) (quoting FTC v. Motion Picture Adver.

support of an order from which an appeal has been taken any matter appearing in the record, at

an alternate basis and disregarding cross-appeal reply brief).
In Rambus, as in this case, the presiding administrative law judge dismissed the
complaint and Complaint Counsel appealed. Rambus, 2006 FTC LEXIS 60, at *28-32. In
Rambus, however, the respondent limited its cross-appeal to the narrow issue of whether the
administrative law judge applied the correct burden of proof in the initial decision.2 Id. at *3334. The respondent did not, as LabMD proposes here, base its cross-appeal on “the absence of
certain findings of fact and/or conclusions of law” in the initial decision and address twelve
different issues that may have “provided additional and/or alternative grounds” for affirmance.
Notice at 2. Nor is there any reason to. The Rules make clear that upon appeal the Commission
will review the record de novo by considering “such parts of the record as are cited or as may be
necessary to resolve the issues presented and … exercis[ing] all the powers which [the
Commission] could have exercised if it had made the initial decision.” Rule 3.54, 16 C.F.R.
§ 3.54; see also Rambus, 2006 FTC LEXIS 60, at *44.3

Respondent has previously briefed the principal issues of law and fact identified in
Respondent’s Notice of Appeal. Complaint Counsel has no objection to the Commission’s
consideration of those voluminous submissions as part of the Commission’s de novo review of
the entire record in this proceeding. Rule 3.54(a), 16 C.F.R. § 3.54(a).

resolves the matter.
Because Complaint Counsel’s Notice of Appeal is proper, LabMD is not entitled to any
of the relief sought in its cross-motion, including its request for a more definite statement and its
request for leave to file an overlength answering brief in response to Complaint Counsel’s appeal
brief.
To the extent that the Commission nonetheless considers LabMD’s request for leave to
file an overlength answering brief independently of LabMD’s cross-motion to strike, it should be
denied for the additional reason that LabMD has failed to meet its burden. Cross-Motion at 7.
“Extensions of word count limitations are disfavored, and will only be granted where a party can
make a strong showing that undue prejudice would result from complying with the existing
limit.” Rule 3.52(k), 16 C.F.R. § 3.52(k). LabMD claims that its compliance with Rule 3.51(b)
somehow justifies increasing the existing word count limit. Cross-Motion at 7. LabMD does not
identify “[a]ny objection to a ruling by the Administrative Law Judge, or to a finding, conclusion
or a provision of the order in the initial decision,” as required by cited Rule 3.51(b), that LabMD
seeks to challenge. Nor does LabMD make any showing – much less a “strong showing” – of
how “undue prejudice would result from complying with the existing [word count] limit,” as
required by Rule 3.52(k). In addition, LabMD has failed to marshal a single FTC decision in
which the Commission extended the word count limitation for an answering appeal brief under
similar circumstances. LabMD should not be permitted to do so here.

the description “email regarding LabSoft,” which does not indicate that it involves attorneyclient communication or an attorney’s mental processes. Complaint Counsel did not challenge
the immunity from production asserted as to this document because of the Commission’s broad
Rule 3.31(c)(5) protection for documents prepared in anticipation of litigation.
B.

NOTES AND DRAFTS

Each of the notes and drafts on Complaint Counsel’s privilege log was prepared in
anticipation of litigation by or at the direction of Complaint Counsel. The documents relating to
communications with the Sacramento Police Department relate to the incident referenced in
Paragraph 21 of the Complaint. Mr. Wilmer’s materials relate to his work identifying consumers
likely to be harmed by Respondent’s conduct, as alleged in Paragraph 22 of the Complaint.
Complaint Counsel’s privilege log as to internal documents is sufficient under Rule 3.38A.
III.

COMPLAINT COUNSEL’S COMMUNICATION WITH HHS
Complaint Counsel’s privilege log includes five categories of correspondence with HHS6:

jurisdiction and venue for the Commission’s CID enforcement proceeding, LabMD’s compliance
with HIPAA and other statutes, litigation strategy in the instant proceeding, analysis of the

6

Respondent’s requested remedy is a “proper privilege log,” not access to documents on the log.
These documents are not relevant to any claim or defense. Complaint Counsel has not raised
relevance in this Opposition because of the limited relief Respondent seeks, and does not herein
waive its relevance assertions.
If Respondent seeks production of protected communications with HHS, Complaint
Counsel submits that HHS must be served with any such motion and permitted an opportunity to
be heard by the Court. See, e.g., In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 902 F.2d 244, 248 (4th Cir. 1990)
(joint privilege cannot be waived without consent of all parties).

instant proceeding, and availability and retention of experts. Each of these categories constitute
work product prepared in anticipation of litigation. Where its communications with HHS were
not privileged, Complaint Counsel provided documents to Respondents.
The FTC and HHS share a common interest in the protection of consumer information, as
recognized by the Commission’s Order Denying Respondent LabMD’s Motion to Dismiss. See
Comm’n Order at 11 ( “[T]he patient-information protection requirements of HIPAA are largely
consistent with the data security duties that the Commission has enforced pursuant to the FTC
Act.”). Indeed, Respondent has asserted throughout this proceeding that HHS has jurisdiction
over its data security practices. See, e.g., Respondent LabMD, Inc.’s Motion to Dismiss
Complaint with Prejudice and to Stay Administrative Proceedings at 10-14.
Where parties share a common interest, privileged information may be shared without
breaching the protection. All the HHS documents appearing on the log are protected work
product prepared in anticipation of litigation. However, in order to preserve all the
Commission’s and HHS’s privileges, Complaint Counsel also claimed Law Enforcement and
Deliberative Process protections for certain of the documents.
A.

COMMON INTEREST DOCTRINE

The common interest doctrine “permits parties whose legal interests coincide to share
privileged materials with one another in order to more effectively prosecute … their claims.”
Hunton & Williams v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 590 F.3d 272, 277 (4th Cir. 2010). A common
interest requires neither a written agreement nor participation in litigation. Am. Mgmt Services,
LLC v. Dep’t of the Army, 842 F. Supp. 2d 859, 876 (E.D. Va. 2012); see also Nat’l Inst. Of Mil.

Docket No. 9357
PUBLIC

ORDER
In an Initial Decision and Order issued on November 13, 2015, Chief Administrative Law
Judge D. Michael Chappell dismissed the complaint against Respondent LabMD, Inc., finding
that Complaint Counsel failed to prove that the alleged conduct at issue caused or was likely to
cause substantial injury to consumers. We address two motions filed by the parties relating to
the ensuing appeal to the Commission.
On November 24, 2015, Complaint Counsel filed a Notice of Appeal of the Initial
Decision. Despite having prevailed before the ALJ, Respondent filed a “Notice of Conditional
Cross-Appeal” a week later, arguing that a “conditional, protective cross-appeal in response to
Complaint Counsel’s notice of appeal is proper even where, as here, the administrative law
judge’s initial decision and proposed order dismissed the complaint in its entirety.” CrossAppeal Notice at 1. Thereafter, on December 7, 2015, Complaint Counsel filed a “Motion to
Enforce Limits on Appeal Briefing” arguing that LabMD’s “cross-appeal” is improper and
seeking an order requiring that LabMD present all of its arguments in support of the Initial
Decision in its answering brief, including any alternate grounds for affirming. On December 14,
2015, LabMD filed its opposition to Complaint Counsel’s motion; alternatively, LabMD seeks
leave to file an over-length answering brief. LabMD also moved to strike Complaint Counsel’s
Notice of Appeal claiming it is too indefinite. On December 17, 2015, Complaint Counsel filed
its opposition to LabMD’s motion to strike.
While our rules plainly permit the filing of cross-appeals 1 – that is, appeals challenging
all or part of a given initial decision or order that are filed by parties other than the party that
filed the first notice of appeal – LabMD is not challenging any part of the ALJ’s Initial Decision.
1

See Commission Rule of Practice 3.52, 16 C.F.R. § 3.52(b)(1); see also Federal Trade Commission Amendments
to Parts 3 and 4 of its Rules of Practice, 74 Fed. Reg. 1804, 1819 (Jan. 13, 2009), available at
https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/federal register notices/rules-practice-16-cfr-parts-3-and4/090113rulesofpractice.pdf.

PUBLIC

LabMD states instead that the ALJ’s Initial Decision and Order “were both correct and should be
affirmed.” Cross-Appeal Notice at 2. Moreover, we disagree with LabMD’s argument that it
must file a “protective cross-appeal” in order to preserve issues for appeal to a federal circuit
court. 16 C.F.R. § 3.54(a). Under LabMD’s reasoning, every case in which one party prevails
could result in an appeal by the unsuccessful party and a second, purported “protective crossappeal” by the victor. Such a result would be inconsistent with general appellate practice and
would prove highly burdensome and wasteful for all involved. Consequently, LabMD is not
entitled to file an opening appeal brief.
Of course, LabMD is certainly entitled to make, in an answering brief, conditional
arguments setting forth alternate grounds for affirmance of the ALJ’s decision. In view of the
number of issues that may be raised in connection with Complaint Counsel’s appeal, we find that
LabMD’s request for leave to file a longer answering brief is justified in this case. We have
determined to increase the word limit for LabMD’s answering brief by 7,000 words. We
likewise increase Complaint Counsel’s word limit for its reply brief by 7,000 words and extend
by a few days the deadline by which it must be filed.
We now turn to LabMD’s cross-motion to strike Complaint Counsel’s Notice of Appeal.
We disagree with LabMD’s assertion that Complaint Counsel’s notice is deficient due to a lack
of specificity. Commission Rule of Practice 3.52 requires only that a notice of appeal “specify
the party or parties against whom the appeal is taken and shall designate the initial decision and
order or part thereof appealed from.” 16 C.F.R. § 3.52(b)(1). There is no question that
Complaint Counsel’s Notice of Appeal complies with Rule 3.52. There is thus no basis for
striking it. 2
Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT while Respondent may not file an opening appeal
brief, it may file an answering brief that shall not exceed 21,000 words. Any such answering
brief must be filed on or before February 5, 2016; and
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT Complaint Counsel may file a reply brief that
shall not exceed 14,000 words. Any such reply brief must be filed on or before February 23,
2016.

Dissenting Statement of Commissioner J. Thomas Rosch
Petitions of LabMD, Inc. and Michael J. Daugherty
to Limit or Quash the Civil Investigative Demands
FTC File No. 1023099
June 21, 2012
I dissent from the Commission’s vote affirming Commissioner Brill’s letter decision,
dated April 20, 2012, that denied the petitions of LabMD, Inc. and Michael J. Daugherty to limit
or quash the civil investigative demands.
I generally agree with Commissioner Brill’s decision to enforce the document requests
and interrogatories, and to allow investigational hearings to proceed. As she has concluded,
further discovery may establish that there is indeed reason to believe there is Section 5 liability
regarding petitioners’ security failings independent of the “1,718 File” (the 1,718 page
spreadsheet containing sensitive personally identifiable information regarding approximately
9,000 patients) that was originally discovered through the efforts of Dartmouth Professor M. Eric
Johnson and Tiversa, Inc. In my view, however, as a matter of prosecutorial discretion under the
unique circumstances posed by this investigation, the CIDs should be limited. Accordingly,
without reaching the merits of petitioners’ legal claims, I do not agree that staff should further
inquire – either by document request, interrogatory, or investigational hearing – about the 1,718
File.
Specifically, I am concerned that Tiversa is more than an ordinary witness, informant, or
“whistle-blower.” It is a commercial entity that has a financial interest in intentionally exposing
and capturing sensitive files on computer networks, and a business model of offering its services
to help organizations protect against similar infiltrations. Indeed, in the instant matter, an
argument has been raised that Tiversa used its robust, patented peer-to-peer monitoring
technology to retrieve the 1,718 File, and then repeatedly solicited LabMD, offering

PUBLIC

investigative and remediation services regarding the breach, long before Commission staff
contacted LabMD. In my view, while there appears to be nothing per se unlawful about this
evidence, the Commission should avoid even the appearance of bias or impropriety by not
relying on such evidence or information in this investigation.

EXPERT OPINION DECLARATION OF CLIFF BAKER
In accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746, the declarant, Cliff Baker states:
1.

I am Cliff Baker. I submit this declaration for use in the lawsuit

LabMD v. Federal Trade Commission. I offer this declaration to respond to
statements in the Expert Report of Professor Hill and how her opinions on data
security relate to requirements on data security for HIPAA-covered medical
service providers imposed by the Department of Health and Human Services.
HIPAA stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
I base my declaration on my personal knowledge and professional experiences.
2.

I, Cliff Baker, have had the following roles in my career in the field of

data security:

Case 1:14-cv-00810-WSD Document 17-6 Filed 04/11/14 Page 2 of 14
PUBLIC

a. Director in the Healthcare Information Security practice at
PricewaterhouseCoopers. I led the security practice nationally for
the Healthcare Consulting practice. I worked at
PricewatershouseCoopers for 14 years and consulted with clients
nationally on implementing security programs and practices. An
example of a project I led was a establishing a program that
included four state healthcare associations. The program included
meeting, discussing and educating over 50 organizations on
adopting security measures to comply with HIPAA.
b. Chief Strategy Officer for HITRUST. I joined HITRUST in 2008
to lead the creation of the Common Security Framework, which is
a healthcare industry framework based on globally recognized
standards, such as ISO 27001/2 and NIST. A key objective of the
framework is to provide a prescriptive and scalable reference for
covered entities to determine reasonable and appropriate controls
to implement for their organizations. The controls are tailored to
the size and operations of the organization. I facilitated working
sessions with over 200 security professionals from the healthcare

PUBLIC

industry, security technology companies, consulting companies,
and government entities in the development of the framework.
c. Founder and Managing Partner of Meditology Services.
Meditology Services was founded in 2010 to provide privacy and
security services to healthcare clients. I employ former Chief
Information Security and Privacy Officers that were responsible
for implementing security at their healthcare organizations. We
provide consulting services in the areas of compliance with
HIPAA and the implementation of privacy and security programs
for healthcare organizations ranging from small providers to global
healthcare organizations.
3.

I have spent over 19 years working in the healthcare and information

security fields. This experience has provided me with first-hand knowledge about
the challenges and practical realities faced by healthcare organizations in securing
Protected Health Information (PHI).
4.

The 1996 HIPAA Statute states that in promulgating information

security regulations, the Secretary must take into account “the needs and
capabilities of small health care providers and rural health care providers (as such
providers are defined by the Secretary),” and the preamble to the HIPAA Security
3

Case 1:14-cv-00810-WSD Document 17-6 Filed 04/11/14 Page 4 of 14
PUBLIC

Rule (p. 8335) states accordingly that one of the foundations of the rule is that “it
should be scalable, so that it can be effectively implemented by covered entities of
all types and sizes.”
5.

The process by which HHS promulgated the initial final HIPAA

Security Rule involved reviewing and responding to approximately 2,350 timely
public comments, balancing the interests of health care professionals and firms
with patient-related interests. Based on these public comments, HHS crafted a
unique information security regulatory scheme that separated “implementation
specifications” – the types of very specific security requirements emphasized by
the FTC’s expert – into two classes: “required” and “addressable”. HHS stayed
consistent with this structure in its most recent updates to the HIPAA Privacy and
Security rules in 2013. This structure reflects HHS’ challenge in complying with
Congressional intent in establishing a security rule to address reasonable and
appropriate security requirements for the range of organizations in healthcare that
differ greatly in operations, size, complexity, and resources. For example, a single
physician practice may differ significantly from the way in which it addresses
security as compared to a multi-national health plan. The physician practice will
probably not employ dedicated technology or security personnel and will rely
heavily on guidance from HHS. The practice will also rely predominantly on
4

Case 1:14-cv-00810-WSD Document 17-6 Filed 04/11/14 Page 5 of 14
PUBLIC

security that is provided by default settings and software vendor recommendations
and will implement mostly manual procedures to manage and monitor access to
patient information and associated Information Technology (IT) systems. On the
other end of the spectrum, a national health system will likely hire a team of
experienced security professionals that may even exceed the total number of
employees in these small practices. These larger organizations will buy and build
the most advanced and sophisticated solutions available in their efforts to protect
sensitive patient data.
6.

HIPAA demands that a covered entity perform a risk assessment in

good faith and take actions to secure Electronic Protected Health Information
(EPHI) based on the findings of that risk assessment. HIPAA’s security
requirements are also explicitly “scalable” based on the size of the
entity. Therefore, to assess HIPAA noncompliance, it is necessary to determine if
a risk assessment was performed in good faith, and resulted in a process that
included implementation of requirements and appropriate responses to
“addressable” issues. These responses are all subject to different standards and
scalable so that they could be implemented effectively by covered entities of all
types and sizes. Given the limited knowledge of information technology by many
small health care providers, especially during the early years of HIPAA Security,
5

Case 1:14-cv-00810-WSD Document 17-6 Filed 04/11/14 Page 6 of 14
PUBLIC

many of the security measures they were advised to adopt by HHS issued guidance
related to physical and administrative security rather than specific technical
security.
7.

The preamble to the Rule makes the balancing of interests and the

assessment of feasibility for small providers by HHS, employing notice and
comment rulemaking, quite transparent at many points. For example, in
connection with encryption of data in transit, which corresponds to Section
164.312(e)(1) of the Rule on Transmission Security, the preamble notes (FR V. 68,

[W]e agree that encryption should not be a mandatory requirement for
transmission over dial-up lines. We also agree with commenters who
mentioned the financial and technical burdens associated with the
employment of encryption tools. Particularly when considering situations
faced by small and rural providers, it became clear that there is not yet
available a simple and interoperable solution to encrypting email
communications with patients. As a result, we decided to make the use of
encryption in the transmission process an addressable implementation
specification.

This concept was reinforced by CMS in a seven-part series published

to provide guidance to the industry for complying with HIPAA. In Volume 2
Security Standards: Implementation for Small Provider of the HIPAA Security
Series published in December 2007, CMS states:

All covered entities must comply with the applicable standards,
implementation specifications, and requirements of the Security Rule with
respect to EPHI (see 45 C.F.R § 164.302.). Small providers that are covered
entities have unique business and technical environments that provide both
opportunities and challenges related to compliance with the Security Rule.
As such, this paper provides general guidance to providers such as
physicians and dentists in solo or small group practices, small clinics,
independent pharmacies, and others who may be less likely to have IT staff
and whose approach to compliance would generally be very different from
that of a large health care system. It is important to note however, that this
paper does not define a small provider, nor does it prescribe specific actions
that small providers must take to become compliant with the Security Rule.

These comments reflect the challenges of small providers in the early

years of HIPAA, but even as more recently as 2013 and 2014, HHS is still
publishing security guidance for small providers, and the guidance is still
elementary in nature. This is reflected by the following list of recommendations
published in the most recent version of the Guide to Privacy and Security of Health
Information, published by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health
Information Technology in 2013:
Remember the Basics
•

Is your server in a room only accessible by authorized
staff? Do you keep the door locked?

•

Are your passwords easily found (e.g., taped to a
monitor)? Easy to guess?

7

•

Do you have a fire extinguisher that works?

•

Where, when, and how often do you back-up? Is at least
one back-up kept offsite? Can your data be recovered
from the back-ups?

•

How often is your EHR server checked for viruses?

•

Who has keys to your building? Any former employees
or contractors?

•

What is your plan for what to do if your server crashes
and you cannot directly recover data? Do you have
documentation about what kind of server it was, what
software it used, etc.?

These recommendations reflect HHS’ understanding of the realities

associated with implementing security for small providers in the healthcare
industry. After almost ten years of complying with HIPAA security rules, the
guidance has not changed substantively for small practices. In more recent years,
HHS has focused on requiring security functionality to be built into applications
for the healthcare industry, so providers will have many security controls by
default and not have to rely on expertise, additional tools and resource intensive
processes to protect information.

I have reviewed Dr. Hill’s Report, and believe that the standards

articulated by Dr. Hill are:
a. Confusing by introducing additional security principles (i.e., 7
security principles referenced by Dr. Hill) that are difficult to
reconcile with the Administrative, Technical and Physical main
structure of the HIPAA security rule.
b. Not scalable in accordance with the Security Rule, and not taking
account as required by the 1996 HIPAA Statute of “the needs and
capabilities of small health care providers and rural health care
providers (as such providers are defined by the Secretary). For
example, the recommendation for file integrity monitoring requires
expertise to implement and configure these solutions and can be
even more resource intensive to understand, investigate and
resolve alerts produced by the solution. In my experience, I very
rarely observe adoption of this technology by small providers in
the industry.
c. More prescriptive than HIPAA or inconsistent with HHS guidance,
including encryption at rest (an addressable requirement of
164.312(a)(1)), encryption in transit (an addressable requirement
9

Case 1:14-cv-00810-WSD Document 17-6 Filed 04/11/14 Page 10 of 14
PUBLIC

of 164.312(e)(1)), intrusion detection (not addressed specifically
by the Security Rule), virus protection (an addressable requirement
of 164.308(a)(5) (ii)(B)), firewalls (not addressed specifically by
the Security Rule), penetration testing (not addressed by the
Security Rule), and file integrity monitoring (not addressed
specifically by the Security Rule). While many of these standards
are good security practices, controls such as broad scale encryption
at rest are generally not adopted across the industry. The
electronic health record certification requirements published for
HHS for Meaningful Use Stage 2 in 2012 do not even require this
level of encryption for all PHI stored by the system. In addition,
tools such as intrusion detection and file integrity monitoring
systems require experienced and committed technical resources to
configure and manage. Dr. Hill’s standards presume a level of
knowledge of technical information security generally not
available to small health care providers.
d. Contradictory to the guidance provided by HHS. For example, Dr.
Hill almost exclusively focuses on technologies or technical
processes for the risk assessment process (i.e., antivirus
10

Case 1:14-cv-00810-WSD Document 17-6 Filed 04/11/14 Page 11 of 14

applications, firewalls, various types of vulnerability scans,
intrusion detection systems, penetration tests, file integrity
monitoring, and other measures). This is inconsistent with HHS
guidance that the risk assessment can be a qualitative and manual
process as outlined in the standard referenced by Dr. Hill: Special
Publication NIST 800-30 Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.
12.

If health care providers are going to be held to a compliance standard

that is simply an expert’s opinion of best practices in information security at any
point in time, when that expert standard exceeds the published compliance
standard developed under HIPAA and the historical guidance provided by HHS,
then the standard developed under HIPAA is made effectively meaningless. This
will create confusion for Health care providers that will not know what is required
of them.
13.

I have not reviewed whether LabMD is or was compliant with the

HIPAA Security Rule; I suggest only that for HIPAA not to be contradicted and
Congressional intent and constitutional process not to be undermined, the
information security of HIPAA-covered health care providers must be regulated by
an agency with jurisdiction under the properly promulgated HIPAA Security Rule,

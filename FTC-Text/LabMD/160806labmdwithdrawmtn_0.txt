e.g., Order Granting Motion of Max Kravitz to Withdraw as Counsel for DBS Laboratories, LLC,
Jn the Matter of Dynamic Health of Florida, LLC et al., FTC Dkt. No. 9317, 2004 FTC LEXIS

LabMD does !!!!! consent to such withdrawal at this time.
Respondent's Counsel requests that the Commission enter an Order withdrawing CoA
Institute and said Counsel from representation of LabMD before this Tribunal upon the filing by
Respondent's Counsel of a reply as necessary to Complaint Counsel's answer to LabMD's
application for stay of the Final Order pending review in a United States circuit court of appeals,

ln this case, Cause of Action's withdrawal will have no material adverse effect on LabMD's

interests. The Commission has entered its final decision, and there are no further proceedings
pending except for LabMD's motion to stay the decision pending a petition for review. LabMD
has engaged the law finn of Ropes and Gray LLP to represent it before a United States circuit
court of appeals pursuant to 45 U.S.C. § 45(c). 2 ("Any person, partnership, or corporation required
by an order of the Commission to cease and desist from using any method of competition or act or
practice may obtain a review of such order in the court of appeals of the United States, within any

person, partnership, or corporation resides or carries on business, by filing in the court, within sixty
days from the date of the service of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the
Commission be set aside.") Moreover, the Commission's rules permit LabMD to proceed prose,
if necessary. Commission Rule 4. t (a)(2), 16 C.F.R. § 4.1(a)(2) ("A corporation or association may
be represented by a bona fide officer thereof upon a showing of adequate authorization.").
Even if the withdrawal would result in material adverse effect on the interest of the client,
good cause exists to pennit Cause of Action's withdrawal pursuant to D.C. Rule of Prof Conduct
1.16(b)(4) and (5). 3 See D.C. Ethics Opinion 317 (listing examples of good cause to allow an
attorney's withdrawal, even when prejudice to the client would result). Respondent's Counsel are
not at liberty to elaborate further on the reasons why good cause exists to grant this Motion. See
D.C. R. Prof Cond. 1.6. Cf In re Gonzalez, 773 A.2d 1026, 1030-32 (D.C. 2001) (addressing
improper motion for leave to withdrawal). If the Commission requires further support for the
good-faith basis supporting good cause in the filing of this Motion, Respondent's Counsel request
that any such submission(s) be made in camera and that such submissions exclude information
protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or attorney work product doctrine.
For the foregoing reasons, Respondent's Counsel respectfully request that the Commission

find that no material adverse effects will result from withdrawal or that other good cause exists to
permit withdrawal; and ORDER that the Secretary is directed to withdraw the appearances of

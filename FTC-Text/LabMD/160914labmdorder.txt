DOCKET NO. 9357

ORDER REQUESTING SUPPLEMENTAL FILING

Attorneys of record for Respondent LabMD, Inc., Patrick J. Massari, and Erica L.
Marshall of the Cause of Action Institute (“Counsel of Record”), have filed a motion for leave to
withdraw as counsel of record from this matter. They argue that ceasing their representation of
LabMD would have no material adverse effect on LabMD’s interests, but state that LabMD does
not consent to their withdrawal. Counsel of Record also assert that there is good cause for their
withdrawal. However, they provide no additional information supporting this assertion in their
motion. Instead, they offer to provide such support in camera. Complaint Counsel take no
position on the motion.
It is important for the Commission to have a complete understanding of the relevant facts
as it considers this motion. We therefore direct Counsel of Record to file a short letter to explain
further why good cause exists for their withdrawal from this matter for the Commission to
consider in camera. Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Patrick J. Massari and Erica L. Marshall file a short
letter containing any supplemental information they wish to submit in support of their motion for
leave to withdraw as counsel of record, on or before September 20, 2016. Counsel may request
in camera treatment of their submission in accordance with Commission Rule 3.45. 16 C.F.R.
§ 3.45 (2016).
By the Commission.

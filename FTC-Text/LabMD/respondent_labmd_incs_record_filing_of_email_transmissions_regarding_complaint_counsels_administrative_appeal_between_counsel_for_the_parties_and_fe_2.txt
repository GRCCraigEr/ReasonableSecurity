anticipates that it will respond to Respondent’s requests for relief. I am writing to advise your office that we will file our
response in opposition to Respondent’s request for relief without undue delay.
Please do not hesitate to call me with any questions or concerns.

Thank you for your message.
To be clear, you are asking for a submission via email to you of an edited version of
Respondent’s Corrected Answering Brief, filed at 11:17 p.m. on Friday, February 5, 2016, to
include all of the corrections in the Errata Sheet submitted by Respondent on February 11,
2015. Is this correct? If so, do the changes need to be highlighted in some way?
And given that this document is a filing transmitted through your Office to the Commission, it
should also be filed on the FTC E-Filing system so that it is part of the record, correct?
Please advise.
Thank you.

RE: Request Regarding March 1st Filing, and Arrangements For the Oral Argument
Next Tuesday

Cc:
Subject:

Patrick, thanks for your email message, in which you have confirmed that the compilation
you filed on behalf of Respondent contains only public information already in the record of this
proceeding. With respect to the question you raise, I should note that if Complaint Counsel had
filed a compilation, I would have asked them to provide the same confirmation. More
generally, I should note that the Office of the Secretary routinely asks parties in Part 3 matters
to confirm that the information contained in filings is public in all respects and part of the
record. We request this confirmation where, as here, there is ambiguity as to what portion of a
filing a citation is referencing, or where the citation does not reference an exhibit on the public
record. As the Office does not cite check filings, we seek this confirmation as an added
precaution, so that counsel for the filing party has an opportunity to check and ensure that no
confidential information is inadvertently posted to our public website at FTC.GOV. After
receiving your email, and re-reviewing your filing, we now understand that the “OGR Report –
released May 2015” that you reference beginning in Slide 5 and throughout your compilation is,
in fact, RX 644, the January 2015 Report to which you cite in Slide 6. We also now understand
that the citations to the OGR Report found on Slides 20, 21 and 24 refer to the emails
themselves, and not the statements immediately above the citation.
Everyone, as you know, the Oral Argument will be held in Room 532-H of the
Headquarters Building next Tuesday, beginning at 1 pm, and I wanted to let you know that both
sides will be able to check the computer and other facilities in Room 532-H either Monday
afternoon (time to be determined) or Tuesday morning. Please let me know if you would like to
check the room at either of those times. Thanks.

Importance: High

Secretary Clark,
Thank you for your message. However, Counsel for LabMD is unaware of any instance in this
matter where the Secretary’s Office formally questioned a filing by Complaint Counsel
regarding adherence to an order. This appears to be a singular request for LabMD.
Has an objection been raised to our filing? If so, it should be entered on the Record. If not (and
I have not seen any such objection from Complaint Counsel), why is Respondent being singled
out here? Please advise.
This case has gone on for 6 years –– there really is nothing new under the sun. The slides all
contain information referenced in the Initial Decision (in whole or in part), with the possible
exception of Associate Director Mary Engle’s July 24, 2007 statement before the House
Oversight Committee, referenced in Respondent’s post-trial briefing. Complaint Counsel is or
should be well-aware of all the information in the slides. The topic headers are part of
Respondent’s Closing Argument and support positions advanced by LabMD in this litigation.
So that is where we are. Please advise as requested.
Thank you.

Secretary Clark,
Thank you for your message. However, Counsel for LabMD is unaware of any instance in this
matter where the Secretary’s Office formally questioned a filing by Complaint Counsel
regarding adherence to an order. This appears to be a singular request for LabMD.
Has an objection been raised to our filing? If so, it should be entered on the Record. If not (and
I have not seen any such objection from Complaint Counsel), why is Respondent being singled
out here? Please advise.
This case has gone on for 6 years –– there really is nothing new under the sun. The slides all
contain information referenced in the Initial Decision (in whole or in part), with the possible
exception of Associate Director Mary Engle’s July 24, 2007 statement before the House
1

PUBLIC

Oversight Committee, referenced in Respondent’s post-trial briefing. Complaint Counsel is or
should be well-aware of all the information in the slides. The topic headers are part of
Respondent’s Closing Argument and support positions advanced by LabMD in this litigation.
So that is where we are. Please advise as requested.
Thank you.

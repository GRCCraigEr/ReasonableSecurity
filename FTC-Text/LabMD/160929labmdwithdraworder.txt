ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO WITHDRAW AS COUNSEL OF RECORD
On September 6, 2016, Patrick J. Massari and Erica L. Marshall of the Cause of Action
Institute moved to withdraw as counsel of record for LabMD, Inc. In their motion, LabMD’s
counsel assert that there is good cause for permitting their withdrawal and that withdrawal will
not prejudice the interests of LabMD once briefing in connection with LabMD’s application for
stay of the Commission’s final order pending appellate review is complete. They note further
that LabMD has retained counsel to represent it in its petition for review of the Commission’s
final order. LabMD, however, does not consent to the withdrawal. LabMD’s counsel and
LabMD each filed supplemental in camera and ex parte submissions related to counsel’s motion
on September 20, 2016.
We have determined to permit Mr. Massari and Ms. Marshall to withdraw as counsel of
record in this proceeding. The Commission has now ruled on LabMD’s stay application, and
this administrative proceeding has thus concluded. Indeed, LabMD’s new appellate counsel
have informed the Commission that LabMD intends to file a petition for review of the
Commission’s Decision and Final Order with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Thus,
LabMD’s counsel may withdraw as counsel of record from this proceeding without any
prejudice to LabMD. Accordingly,
IT IS ORDERED that Patrick J. Massari and Erica L. Marshall’s Motion for Leave to
Withdraw as Counsel of Record for Respondent LabMD, Inc. is hereby GRANTED.
By the Commission.

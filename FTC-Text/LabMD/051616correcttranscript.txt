ORDER CORRECTING ORAL ARGUMENT TRANSCRIPT
On May 4, 2016, Complaint Counsel filed an unopposed Motion to correct the transcript
of the Oral Argument held in this proceeding on March 8, 2016. The Motion states that
Complaint Counsel conferred with counsel for Respondent in a good faith effort to stipulate to
the desired corrections, as prescribed by Commission Rule 3.52(i), 16 C.F.R. § 3.52(i), and that
while Respondent has declined to join the Motion, Respondent agrees to the proposed
corrections and will not oppose the Motion. Accordingly,
IT IS ORDERED THAT the Oral Argument Transcript be, and it hereby is, modified to
adopt the two corrections requested by Complaint Counsel in the May 4 Motion, and to read as
shown in the attached corrected copy.
By the Commission.

2

Commission.
This is a case about a company whose very

3

business model depended on collecting and maintaining

4

hundreds of thousands of consumers' most sensitive

5

categories of personal information, including names,

6

dates of birth, Social Security numbers, health

7

insurance information and medical diagnoses, but LabMD

8

did not put in place even the most basic protections to

9

secure that information from unauthorized disclosure.

10

LabMD's multiple, systemic and serious failures

11

violated section 5 of the FTC Act because they

12

unlawfully caused or likely caused substantial consumer

13

injury that consumers could not avoid and that was not

14

outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or

15

competition.

16

Applying the settled law of the Commission, this

17

is not a close case for the Commission in its de novo

18

review of the record on appeal.

19

overwhelming evidence in this case, it's important to

20

first address the initial decision's three most

21

significant errors of law that complaint counsel is

22

challenging.

23

But before I review the

First, the initial decision was wrong in

24

holding that an act or practice that raises a

25

significant risk of concrete harm does not cause

5
1
2

substantial consumer injury.
This Commission has recognized that a practice

3

causes or likely causes substantial -- excuse me --

4

that -- this Commission has recognized that a practice

5

causes or is likely to cause substantial injury if it

6

raises a significant risk of concrete harm.

7

The Commission's holding is grounded in

8

Section 5(n), which codified the unfairness statement.

9

And the Commission's reasoning is affirmed by case law

10

applying primary sources.

11

with the Commission's broad mandate to prevent acts or

12

practices that injure the public.

13

The standard is consistent

The initial decision's ruling to the contrary

14

cannot be reconciled with this authority, which is

15

controlling in this case and in any data security case

16

brought under the FTC's unfairness authority.

17

Second --

18

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

19

you a question on that first prong, the

20

first “error,” that you're arguing?

21

MS. VANDRUFF:

22

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

Counsel, could I just ask

Yes.
Are you saying that

23

raising a significant risk of concrete harm equals

24

substantial injury, or that it is likely to cause

25

substantial injury?

6
1

MS. VANDRUFF:

Nothing about the law of

2

Section 5 has changed since the Commission issued its

3

opinion on the motion to dismiss in January of 2014.

4

And in that opinion, the Commission held that an act or

5

practice may cause substantial injury if it causes a

6

small harm to a large number of people or raises a

7

significant risk of concrete harm.

8

And to back up for a moment,

9

Commissioner Ohlhausen, the Commission's order on that

10

motion to dismiss also observed that actual, completed

11

economic harms are not necessary to substantiate that a

12

firm's data security activities caused or likely caused

13

consumer injury and thus constitute unfair acts or

14

practices.

15

Therefore, for data security practices to be

16

unfair without the occurrence of a breach, it must

17

follow that for -- that what makes poor data security

18

practices actionable under Section 5 is the risk of

19

concrete harm that they --

20
21

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Counsel, I want to

spend a little bit of time here on the legal standard.

22

MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

23

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Can you tell me -- so

24

your position is that there was actual harm in

25

this case; correct?

7
1

MS. VANDRUFF:

That's correct.

2

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

And could you outline for

3

me what that actual harm was.

4

MS. VANDRUFF:

So to go back to

5

Commissioner Ohlhausen's question, the actual harm was

6

the significant risk of concrete harm that was created

7

by the data security practices and the failures of

8

adequate security that LabMD undertook in not

9

safeguarding adequately the sensitive personal

10

information for 750,000 consumers.

11

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Counsel, I'd like you

12

to answer the question -- what does the likely --

13

likelihood piece of the unfairness standard mean?

14

Respondent is arguing that, if one were

15

to accept your position, you're effectively reading

16

out of the statute the word "likely," so can you explain

17

to me then, what is the meaning of that second part

18

of the unfairness test?

19

MS. VANDRUFF:

20

"likely" moot at all.

21

remains cognizable also.

22

standard at all.

23

It doesn't -- it doesn't render
A likely substantial injury
There's no change to that

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So

24

again, I'm just trying to understand what "likely

25

to cause" means, and is that distinct

8
1

from actual harm?

Because you're arguing that risk -- a

2

significant risk of concrete harm -- constitutes actual

3

harm, correct?

4

MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

5

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So how distinct is the

6

"likely to cause substantial harm" prong of the

7

unfairness test?

8

anything different?

9
10
11

Does that mean

MS. VANDRUFF:

I want to make sure that I

understand your question.
A significant risk of concrete harm is itself

12

substantial injury.

13

that injury is occurring at present, if the acts or

14

practices of a company cause that injury to occur, then

15

that risk occurs at present.

16

If that injury is -- occurs -- if

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So let me frame it a

17

little bit differently.

If your position is

18

that a significant risk of concrete harm is a completed

19

harm, tell me how you would go about establishing a

20

likelihood of substantial injury.

21

if there's a distinction there.

I'm trying to see

22

MS. VANDRUFF:

Right.

23

Well, I -- I want to --

24

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

25

right, it means something different.

It's a different standard,
Does "actual harm"

9
1

mean something different than "likely to cause

2

substantial injury"?

3

proof presumably under that piece of the --

There's a different standard of

4

MS. VANDRUFF:

The likely, yes.

5

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

6

MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

So to show that something would

7

be “likely” would suggest that it would occur in the

8

future, and so -- so that is --

9

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

10

MS. VANDRUFF:

So a temporal distinction.

It's a temporal distinction, as

11

we set forth in our briefing, that is correct,

12

Madam Chairwoman, yes.

13

If there are no further questions on that

14

subject, then what I would move on to is the second

15

error in the initial decision, and that is that the

16

initial decision was wrong in holding that

17

Section 5 requires proof of known identity theft.

18

Indeed, this Commission in this proceeding has

19

held that the FTC permits the Commission to challenge

20

multiple and systemic data security failures even where

21

no breach has occurred.

22

And finally, the initial decision was wrong --

23

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

24
25

that -MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

Counselor, can I ask, is

10
1

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

2

failures are likely to cause substantial

3

injury or that they themselves cause substantial

4

injury?

5

-- because systemic

That is, complaint counsel doesn't have to show that

6

there's a breach because the failures are likely to

7

cause substantial injury?

8
9

MS. VANDRUFF:

Commissioner Ohlhausen, I

believe that the reasoning for the Commission's

10

observation that complaint counsel need not show proof

11

of a breach is because a significant risk of concrete

12

harm is sufficient to show substantial injury, as I set

13

forth in response to your initial question.

14

And finally, the initial decision was wrong in

15

requiring complaint counsel to present expert testimony

16

quantifying the probability of injury.

17

Section 5 does not impose this requirement.

18

Rather, complaint counsel must present and did present

19

reasonably available evidence of the risk posed to

20

consumers by a company's poor data security practices.

21

LabMD's data security practices exemplify the

22

conduct against which the FTC Act protects consumers.

23

Its practices caused or were likely to cause significant

24

risk of the concrete harms of identity theft, medical

11
1

identity theft, and the unauthorized disclosure for

2

hundreds of thousands of consumers, most of whom had

3

probably never heard of LabMD.

4

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Was there any other actual

5

harm other than the significant risk that you've already

6

cited?

7

MS. VANDRUFF:

So at the outset, that's correct,

8

Madam Chairwoman, that there was a significant risk

9

created for 750,000 consumers.

10

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Okay.

So putting that

11

aside, was there any other --

12

MS. VANDRUFF:

13

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

14

evidence demonstrates, in your view?

So putting that aside --- completed harm that the

15

MS. VANDRUFF:

Right.

16

Putting aside the 750,000 consumers, that the

17

record shows that there was also a file of

18

9300 consumers that was exposed on the peer-to-peer

19

network.

20

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So the exposure of the

21

1718 File itself is also actual, completed harm; is

22

that --

23

MS. VANDRUFF:

That's correct.

24

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

25

MS. VANDRUFF:

And anything else?

And in addition, there was a file

12
1

containing the sensitive personal information of

2

approximately 600 consumers found in the hands of

3

identity thieves in Sacramento, California.

4
5
6

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

Can I ask you a question

about the Sacramento file?
Do you agree with the ALJ's finding that there

7

is no evidence establishing that the Sacramento

8

documents were obtained from LabMD's computer network?

9

MS. VANDRUFF:

So we are not conceding that the

10

Sacramento day sheets -- well, the evidence in the

11

record does not establish how the documents got from

12

LabMD to the identity thieves in Sacramento, but we

13

have established that they are LabMD documents containing

14

sensitive consumer information, and the fact that they

15

were obtained by identity thieves demonstrates exactly

16

the types of concrete injury that result from the

17

unauthorized disclosure of consumers' sensitive personal

18

information.

19

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

I understood that

20

Dr. Hill's testimony basically asserted that he found that

21

the physical security at LabMD was reasonable, or was not

22

unreasonable.

23
24
25

So is that relevant here for establishing where
these documents came from?
MS. VANDRUFF:

Well, as an initial matter, I

13
1

would disagree with that characterization of

2

Professor Hill's opinion.

3

While the allegations of the complaint -- well,

4

first of all, Professor Hill's opinions do not relate to

5

physical security.

6

also relate primarily to failures of electronic

7

security, and those are the focus of Professor Hill's

8

opinions.

9

principles of her opinions are equally applicable to

10
11
12
13

And the allegations of the complaint

But the principles of the complaint and the

physical security.
So, for example, LabMD's failure to have a
written security -CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Complaint Counsel, does

14

your complaint -- the allegations in the complaint, do

15

they relate to computer security or physical security?

16

The ALJ seemed to understand the

17

complaint to be and the allegations in the case to be

18

solely limited to computer security.

19

inaccurate?

20

MS. VANDRUFF:

Is that

The allegations of the complaint

21

relate to electronic security, but the principles are

22

equally applicable to physical security.

23

So, for example, Madam Chairwoman, the

24

allegations include a failure to have a written security

25

policy, and LabMD's failure to have a written security

14
1

plan or to perform risk assessments created an

2

environment in which significant risks to physical

3

security were possible.

4

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So I want to make very

5

clear, notwithstanding the fact that the complaint in

6

paragraph 10 focuses on computer security, are you

7

saying the charges here and the evidence showed that

8

there were also lapses in physical security?

9

what you're saying?

10

MS. VANDRUFF:

Is that

I'm saying there's nothing

11

inconsistent about our proofs to not -- to foreclose

12

conclusions about physical security.

13

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Okay.

So you're also

14

including physical security, that's part of –

15

notwithstanding the language that's used in the complaint,

16

you're including lapses of physical security in the

17

charges.

18

MS. VANDRUFF:

That's right.

The "Among other

19

things" paragraph, Madam Chairwoman, is not an

20

exhaustive list, and so certainly those are examples of

21

the kinds of failures, and as examples, they extend to

22

the kinds of things, including physical security, that's

23

correct.

24

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

25

MS. VANDRUFF:

Okay.

So LabMD's data security

15
1

practices exemplify the kinds of conduct against which

2

the FTC Act protects consumers, and its practices caused

3

or were likely to cause a significant risk of the kinds

4

of concrete harms like identity theft, medical identity

5

theft, and the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive

6

personal information.

7

And when a company's corporate network contains

8

hundreds of thousands of consumers' sensitive personal

9

information, Section 5 of the FTC Act requires a company

10
11
12

to take steps to protect it.
CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Counsel, so going back to

just focusing on the Sacramento documents --

13

MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

-- as

15

the plaintiff in this matter, what obligation do you

16

have to establish a causal link between that exposure of

17

documents and the security practices of respondent, so

18

what amount of proof do you need to establish that

19

there's a link between that and the documents, and how

20

have you shown that?

21

MS. VANDRUFF:

Right.

22

So we -- the record evidence, we have presented

23

evidence from the detectives in Sacramento that

24

demonstrate that the documents that came from LabMD

25

were found in the hands of identity thieves.

16
1

And while we have not been able to establish

2

how those documents came to -- from LabMD to be in the

3

hands of identity thieves, we have demonstrated that the

4

kinds of information that LabMD maintains are the kinds

5

of information that identity thieves value, and so it is

6

very much a concrete harm that consumers will suffer if

7

information that LabMD maintains is exposed without

8

authorization.

9
10
11

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

I have a

question that relates to that.
In your appeal brief on page 7, you said that

12

LabMD created a significant risk of harm by collecting,

13

storing and transferring consumer data in large volumes

14

on a daily basis.

15

Under your theory, is that a significant risk

16

equal to a substantial injury, or does there need to be

17

something more?

18

sensitive health information, is that enough or does

19

there need to be more, if we're just looking at a

20

significant risk?

21

Just the fact that they collected

MS. VANDRUFF:

The collection alone does not

22

create a significant risk.

It's the failure to

23

adequately protect that data, the failure to safeguard

24

that data from unauthorized disclosure, and that is the

25

record that we have established in this case.

17
1

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

So that goes to

2

whether they took reasonable precautions; is that

3

right?

4

MS. VANDRUFF:

That's correct.

5

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

6

And so in the Wyndham case, they

Reasonable precautions?

7

talk about a cost-benefit analysis that considers a

8

number of relevant factors, such as the -- I'm quoting

9

here -- "the probability and expected size of

10

reasonably unavoidable harms to consumers given a

11

certain level of cybersecurity and the costs to

12

consumers that would arise from an investment in

13

stronger cybersecurity."

14

So does your interpretation of 5(n) agree with

15

the Third Circuit's interpretation or does it differ in

16

some way?

17

MS. VANDRUFF:

We are building on the

18

Commission's interpretation of Section 5(n), which I think is

19

entirely consistent with the unfairness statement.

20

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

And is that

21

interpretation you are relying on from Commissioner

22

Wright's decision denying respondent's motion to dismiss?

23

MS. VANDRUFF:

That's correct,

24

Commissioner Ohlhausen, yes.

18
1
2

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

I have a question

about that.

3

MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

4

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

In that opinion, the

5

Commission says that occurrences of actual data security

6

breaches or actual, completed economic harms are not

7

necessary to substantiate that the firm's data security

8

activities caused or are likely to cause consumer

9

injury and thus constituted unfair acts or practices,

10

and then it cites the unfairness statement, which says

11

what is substantial injury: small harm to a large

12

number of people or raises a significant risk of

13

concrete harm.

14

So is it your contention that a

15

significant risk of concrete harm equals substantial

16

injury?

That's correct?

17

MS. VANDRUFF:

That's correct.

18

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

But is it also possible

19

that when Congress interpreted the unfairness statement

20

and recast it in Section 5(n) -- it moved things

21

around, it reversed the order of some of the

22

prongs -- that a significant risk became likely to cause

23

and concrete harm became substantial injury?

24

reading incorrect in some way or not in accord with what

25

Congress said about Section 5(n) or what the unfairness

Is that

19
1

statement said?

2

Do you see what I'm saying?

3

MS. VANDRUFF:

4
5

No, I understand the question,

Commissioner Ohlhausen.
And what I would say is that we don't think

6

that the law has changed in any way since January of

7

2014 and since Commissioner Wright's opinion on behalf

8

of a unanimous Commission requiring the Commission to

9

change the law with respect to significant risk of

10

concrete harm, but the alternative formulation that you

11

suggest, which I think is that likely means significant

12

risk, would not affect the outcome in this case, as the

13

record demonstrates, because complaint counsel has shown

14

that LabMD's practices have caused a significant risk of

15

concrete harm whether you characterize that harm as

16

causing substantial injury or being likely to cause

17

substantial injury.

18
19
20

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

Thank you.

And

that leads us to another question.
So assuming we're judging whether LabMD's

21

actions were likely to cause substantial injury, what

22

type and amount of evidence would meet this standard?

23

Is it a risk analysis, meaning that you need the

24

evidence of both probability of potential harm and

25

magnitude of potential harm, and does the record have

20
1
2

that kind of evidence?
MS. VANDRUFF:

So I think what you're asking is

3

keyed off of the briefing from respondent about what

4

likely --

5

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

Well, I'm just

6

trying to interpret if we have to apply likely

7

to cause substantial injury, which is the statutory

8

language --

9
10
11

MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:
would meet that standard?

12

MS. VANDRUFF:

13

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

14

-- what type of evidence

Right.
And where would

we find that in the record?

15

MS. VANDRUFF:

Right.

16

Well, the term "likely" I don't think there's

17

any question is ambiguous because it is open to multiple

18

interpretations.

19

you've offered, which again is not, in complaint

20

counsel's view, the better reading of the statute --

21

the better reading of the statute, as we've

22

offered in our briefing, is that significant --

23

And if given the interpretation that

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Counsel, let's just put

24

aside what "likely" means.

Let's just take your

25

position that the data security practices in this

21
1

case created some increased or undue risk of exposure of

2

sensitive information.

3

that, this concept of risk.

Let's just -- just focus on

4

MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

5

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

And just to

6

reframe the question so that you focus on what I

7

think we all care about --

8

MS. VANDRUFF:

Okay.

9

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

-- so what evidence

10

establishes that the practice -- security

11

practices --were what created that enhanced risk

12

or increased risk?

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

MS. VANDRUFF:

I'd be delighted to address that

question.
CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

I believe that's what you

were trying to get at.
COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

That is what I'm trying

to get at.
Putting aside the statute versus the

20

unfairness statement and how that may have been

21

one translated into the other, what evidence do

22

we have that --

23

MS. VANDRUFF:

Well, we presented evidence of

24

multiple, systemic and serious failures of data security

25

at LabMD that exposed 750,000 consumers' --

22
1

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

2

top data security practices that --

3

MS. VANDRUFF:

4

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

5

MS. VANDRUFF:

6

So walk us through just the

I will.
-- you think were --

And can you put our first slide

up on the screen.

7

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

And as you go through

8

those, I think one question that respondent has raised

9

is from what time frame should we even be looking at

10

this and against what benchmark are you comparing what

11

LabMD did as compared to what you would deem to be

12

reasonable and appropriate security measures.

13

MS. VANDRUFF:

Right.

14

The testimony in this case and -- and the

15

record evidence I should say -- this is not limited

16

exclusively to our expert witness, but, rather, the

17

testimony in this case is that LabMD's failures spanned

18

really the period, and we're not limited in any way to

19

a narrow time period, as we addressed in our briefing.

20

A suggestion to the contrary is belied by the --

21
22
23
24
25

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

What's the relevant time

frame?
MS. VANDRUFF:

The time period is from

2005 really through the present.
Now, some of the practices ended in 2010, as we

23
1

address in our briefing and in our findings of fact,

2

but many continue through the present.

3

certainly contend that LabMD's unlawful data security

4

practices continue through the present and that relief

5

is necessary to protect consumers from harm.

6
7

And we

So because my time is limited, I'd like to
address the top three data security failures.

8

And those would include, at the outset, first,

9

that LabMD did not implement any recognizable password

10

policy and for years permitted weak passwords on its

11

workstations, servers and computers in physician

12

offices.

13

And when I describe these passwords as weak, I'm

14

not splitting hairs between 12 and 14-character

15

passwords.

16

permitted many of its employees to use "LabMD" as their

17

password.

18

Instead, by way of an example, LabMD

Even LabMD's former IT director acknowledges

19

that its password practices were poor.

20

testimony.

21
22
23

That's his

The company could have checked for passwords,
for strong passwords, and it chose not to.
Second, LabMD did not use available measures to

24

prevent or detect unauthorized access to personal

25

information.

24
1

Until at least late 2010, many employees had

2

the ability to download and install any software they

3

wanted to onto their work computers, including

4

unauthorized programs.

5

security is starkly demonstrated by the fact that an

6

employee downloaded LimeWire onto her workstation in

7

2005, but LabMD utterly failed to discover it for

8

years.

9
10

The danger of this hole in

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:
that for me?

11

MS. VANDRUFF:

12

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

13

program installed?

Sure.

MS. VANDRUFF:

15

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

That's correct.

MS. VANDRUFF:
2008.

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

20

MS. VANDRUFF:

22

And how long is

It was not detected until May of

19

21

Okay.

complaint counsel alleging it remained undetected?

17
18

When was the LimeWire

In 2005?

14

16

So can you just clarify

And how was it detected?

It was detected when LabMD

received a phone call from Tiversa.
COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

And was it detected, then,

23

because there were programs in place to monitor whether

24

outside software was installed on computers? Or was it

25

detected by a physical inspection?

25
1

MS. VANDRUFF:

It was -- no.

It was

2

detected -- the testimony is that it was detected when

3

LabMD undertook to discover whether or not the reported

4

incidence of peer-to-peer software being installed on a

5

computer at LimeWire was in fact true -- excuse me -- at

6

LabMD was in fact true, and so they swept the

7

workstations and discovered that it was.

8

And if the security problem of allowing

9

employees to download software onto their workstations

10

from the Internet wasn't bad enough, LabMD explicitly

11

directed its employees to store copies of files

12

containing consumers' sensitive personal information

13

onto their workstations.

14

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So, Counsel, just to go

15

back to my question about what the relevant benchmark to

16

use, so how should -- respondent raises an argument

17

about lack of appropriate notice about the standards

18

that they were required to maintain during the relevant

19

time frame.

20

to have strong passwords during this period, how should

21

they have known that they needed to have particular

22

mechanisms to ensure that a peer-to-peer program like

23

LimeWire would not be installed?

24

benchmark?

25

Explain to me how should they have known

MS. VANDRUFF:

What's the relevant

Well, the relevant standard, of

26
1

course, is Section 5(n) in terms of the legal standard

2

in terms of fair notice.

3

But if your question is how were their IT

4

professionals to have known that they could have used

5

the Windows function to lock down workstations to

6

prevent individuals from downloading software from the

7

Internet, the answer is training and if they had

8

permitted their IT professionals or really any

9

professionals in their system to have undertaken regular

10

training, and that is one of our failures.

11

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

But the concept of

12

reasonableness has to be measured against something,

13

right, so what's the benchmark?

14

So understanding that you want your employees to be

15

trained appropriately as to the appropriate standards.

16

Where do we get those standards, and where are they

17

reflected in the record?

18

MS. VANDRUFF:

So in the record, our data

19

security expert, Professor Hill from Indiana University,

20

describes a number of free resources that were

21

available.

22

So, for example, written data security

23

policies, examples of those were available as early as

24

1997, and they were not used by LabMD until -- until

25

2010.

27
1

And so that is but one example, but the record

2

is replete with examples throughout the time period of

3

LabMD failing to use available resources to secure its

4

network reasonably to protect the sensitive personal

5

information on its network from unauthorized

6

disclosure.

7

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

Counsel, assuming that they

8

failed to take these precautions, what evidence is in

9

the record about the probability of the harm or the

10

potential harm that consumers might suffer from these

11

failures and the magnitude of that harm?

12

MS. VANDRUFF:

We presented -- I'm glad you

13

raise that question, Commissioner Ohlhausen, because I

14

would like to turn my attention, if I may, to the

15

evidence that complaint counsel presented of the -- the

16

record evidence that LabMD's failures caused or were

17

likely to cause substantial injury.

18

And the record evidence does establish that

19

LabMD's multiple, systemic and serious data security

20

failures caused a significant risk that sensitive

21

personal information over 750,000 consumers would be

22

disclosed without authorization.

23
24

The record -- there are three discrete concrete
harms that are at issue.

28
1

First is identity theft.

2

The record establishes that consumers suffer

3

out-of-pocket losses and lost-time harms following

4

identity theft.

5

And this risk is not abstract, as I discussed

6

earlier this afternoon.

7

identity thieves in Sacramento make concrete that

8

identity thieves value the kind of information LabMD

9

collected.

10
11
12

The LabMD documents seized from

The second risk of concrete harm is medical
identity theft.
The record establishes that consumers suffer a

13

wide variety of harms from medical identity theft, which

14

would burden consumers with financial costs and serious

15

threats to health.

16

theft, there's no central medical identity bureau where

17

a consumer can set a medical fraud alert, making

18

remediation difficult.

19
20
21

And in addition, unlike identity

Third, a disclosure itself constitutes a
concrete harm under Section 5.
Sensitive health information is the type of

22

personal information the Commission has sought to

23

protect since its earliest data security case in 2002,

24

Eli Lilly, through its fiftieth data security settlement

25

in GMR Transcription Services.

29
1
2

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

So can I ask a question

about this?

3

MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

4

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

Are you saying that

5

there's injury from any exposure of any health

6

information?

7

MS. VANDRUFF:

Not -- not necessarily, but the

8

kinds of information that could be stigmatizing.

In

9

this case, there was information about testing for HIV,

10

testing for cancer, testing for other kinds of potentially

11

stigmatizing conditions.

12

I can imagine that there could be health

13

information that might be benign, but those aren't the

14

facts here.

15

in the record here are information that consumers would

16

necessarily want to be maintained as confidential.

17

There are facts here -- the facts that are

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

Counsel, how does that

18

square with the unfairness statement, which talks about

19

substantial injury mainly involving monetary harm, but

20

emotional impact not ordinarily making a practice unfair?

21

How would you apply that to the disclosure of the medical

22

information that was disclosed in this case?

23
24

MS. VANDRUFF:

While I -- the unfairness

statement certainly talks about the principal injury

30
1

being economic, I think that it recognizes that there

2

would be narrow cases, again, not trivial or

3

speculative or emotional harms but -- but the kinds of

4

concrete harms where consumers, you know, again suffer

5

the kinds of harms that result from the disclosure of

6

the most sensitive kinds of information, like being

7

tested for HIV or cancer.

8

different in kind and again has been recognized in our

9

own cases before the Commission.

10
11
12

I do think that that is

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:
analogous case?

What's the most closely

You mentioned Eli Lilly.

MS. VANDRUFF:

GMR Transcription from 2014 I

13

believe it is, yeah, August 2014, which was our

14

fiftieth -- the Commission's fiftieth data security

15

settlement by unanimous Commission.

16
17
18
19
20

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

One other

question.
You talked about the evidence of the
magnitude of the harm.
What evidence do you have that these practices

21

would -- were likely to lead to these harms, that the

22

data security, if they had these kinds of practices,

23

how likely was it that consumers' information

24

would be exposed or released?

25

MS. VANDRUFF:

Well, the -- it was -- the

31
1

testimony -- well, I should say that our data security

2

expert, Professor Hill, demonstrated that the practices

3

of LabMD increased the risk of unauthorized disclosure

4

of information.

5

of our identity theft experts, we have established that

6

those harms -- that there was an increased risk of those

7

concrete harms.

And paired together with the evidence

8

Now, respondent --

9

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

Can I ask one more

10

question? I just want to clarify something about the data

11

security practices you identified here.

12

MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

13

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

To the extent that they

14

were tracking what was on employees' computers that

15

were attached to the network, were they doing that

16

through automated tools or were they doing that through

17

physical inspections or random inspections?

18

MS. VANDRUFF:

The record is that through

19

2010 at least that the principal means of monitoring the

20

network and the software that appeared on employees'

21

computers was through what they called walk-around

22

inspections, and the record is further --

23
24

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:
inspection?

What is a walk-around

32
1

MS. VANDRUFF:

So -- and the record is further

2

that they would basically check in when computers

3

weren't working properly, and so if you had trouble

4

printing, you would call the person at the IT desk, and

5

he would come over and fix it.

6

of routinized process, so it was very reactive, if you

7

will.

8
9

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

And were -- I think you're

out of time.

10

MS. VANDRUFF:

11

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

12

But it wasn't any kind

And I'm out of time.
Go ahead.

We can always go

over a little bit.

13

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

Were physicians who were

14

sending information in to the network doing

15

that without encryption tools or data security tools? Is

16

that right?

17

MS. VANDRUFF:

The evidence is that it was over

18

a file transfer protocol and it is -- we don't contend

19

that it was unencrypted.

20

record is mixed about exactly how protected that was,

21

but that is not a contention that complaint counsel

22

makes.

23

It is -- there's -- the

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

So the use of the file

24

transfer protocol during this period of time isn't

25

alleged by you to be an unreasonable security practice.

33
1

MS. VANDRUFF:

There were vast quantities of

2

data being transferred, and there were issues about the

3

configuration of the firewall, but I don't think that

4

encryption is the concern.

5

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

6

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Thank you.

So just one more question

7

for you, so let me just go back to one of

8

Commissioner Ohlhausen's questions about what evidence

9

establishes the likelihood of harm or probability of

10
11

harm, as she put it.
The ALJ was very persuaded by the absence of a

12

concrete example of ID theft in the time that had

13

elapsed between both the discovery and exposure of the

14

1718 File as well as the Sacramento documents.

15

What role does this, what one could call as a

16

shorthand ex post evidence, have in the way that we

17

evaluate whether data practices were likely to cause

18

substantial injury?

19
20

MS. VANDRUFF:

I don't believe it has a role,

Madam Chairwoman.

21

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

22

MS. VANDRUFF:

Is it relevant at all?

I don't believe it is relevant,

23

particularly in the case of identity theft, because, of

24

course, the ability of a consumer to tie up the

25

incidence of a particular breach to a particular

34
1

experience of identity theft is attenuated at best and

2

impossible in most circumstances, particularly here

3

where no consumer has received notice that the

4

information contained in the 1718 File was exposed on

5

the peer-to-peer network, so there's no ability

6

whatsoever for the 9300 consumers whose information was

7

contained -- was exposed on the peer-to-peer network for

8

eleven months to even know that there's a possibility

9

that --

10

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Okay.

Sure.

And I think

11

what you're saying is that the ALJ -- that what he

12

required, which was showing that one of the 9300 people

13

who had been -- whose information had been exposed in

14

the 1718 File, for instance, the fact that there's no

15

evidence of one of those people having suffered medical

16

ID theft, that is of no relevance.

17

But the fact that there was the exposure of the

18

1718 File, the fact that the Sacramento documents were

19

found in the hands of identity thieves, of what

20

relevance is that to the analysis of whether or not the

21

data security practices were likely to cause substantial

22

injury?

23

Does that tell us anything about whether or not

24

the data security practices were reasonable or

25

unreasonable?

35
1

MS. VANDRUFF:

Right.

I think that the fact of

2

those exposures does suggest that -- I mean, there were

3

incidents of unauthorized disclosure, and so I think

4

that that does point us to -- it shows that the

5

increased risk was further magnified and that the

6

consumers --

7

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

8

MS. VANDRUFF:

9

I'm sorry.

10
11
12

So it is relevant.

It is absolutely relevant, yes.

I thought you were asking a

different question, Madam Chairwoman.
CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

I probably made it too

convoluted.

13

Anyone else?

14

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

15

Sorry, I have one more

question.

16

MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

17

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

How do you respond to

18

LabMD's argument that this investigation was triggered

19

by the receipt of the 1718 File from Tiversa, but that

20

Tiversa's actions in obtaining the file were unlawful?

21

MS. VANDRUFF:

Tiversa is a witness upon whom

22

complaint counsel does not rely in this appeal to the

23

Commission and upon whom complaint counsel did not rely

24

in its briefing, post-trial briefing before the

25

Administrative Law Judge.

36
1

Its relevance in this appeal in the

2

Commission's de novo review is as a third party that

3

provided a tip to the Commission.

4

LabMD was disclosing sensitive personal information on a

5

peer-to-peer network, a tip that proved to be true.

6

The tip was that

The Commission staff investigated that lead and

7

corroborated it with information provided by the

8

respondent.

9

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

10

MS. VANDRUFF:

11

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

12

Can I just ask --

That is the end of the inquiry.
Can I just follow up on

this?

13

MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

14

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

Is it the exposure on the

15

peer-to-peer network of the LabMD file that I should be

16

weighing here? Or is it the presence of LimeWire on the

17

employee computer that went undetected for two-plus

18

years?

19

MS. VANDRUFF:

20

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

21

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

22

Both, Madam Commissioner.
Okay.
I have a

question about the peer-to-peer.

23

There's evidence that one entity

24

accessed or was able to access that file on the

25

peer-to-peer.

37
1
2
3

Do we know whether anyone else was able to
download or access the information?
MS. VANDRUFF:

The record evidence is from --

4

from LabMD's own witness, Richard Wallace, that he was

5

able to use an ordinary computer and an ordinary

6

peer-to-peer client and download the 1718 File.

7

downloaded it on behalf of his then employer, Tiversa,

8

who shared it with a researcher at Dartmouth University.

9

We don't have evidence of whether it was

He

10

otherwise shared because the hard drive on which the

11

LimeWire software was installed and the file -- from

12

which the file was being shared was destroyed during a

13

LabMD forensic investigation, so that is information

14

that complaint counsel was not able to obtain during its

15

investigation.

16

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

So if I understand what

17

you're saying, we know it was capable of being accessed

18

that way and we know somebody did access it that way.

19

We don't know whether others did because the hard drive

20

had been damaged.

21

MS. VANDRUFF:

Correct.

22

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

23

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

24

MS. VANDRUFF:

25

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Okay.

Thank you.

Thank you, Counsel.

Thank you.
You may begin when you're

38
1

ready, Mr. Lechner.

2
3

MR. LECHNER:
Commissioners.

4
5

May it please the Chairwoman and

I would like to start with just some basic
information first.

6

Initially, Dr. Hill unequivocally testified that

7

the physical security at LabMD was adequate, so

8

statements to the contrary are not supported in the

9

record.

10

With regard to the Sacramento files, there is

11

absolutely no evidence that they came off of the LabMD

12

system, computer system, none at all, nothing to

13

support that.

14

raided because of a -- I believe it was utility theft,

15

and maybe it was electric or gas theft, and they found

16

these documents there by questionable individuals who

17

pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of identity theft,

18

but that's not established in the record either.

19

They were found in a house that was

So there's nothing with regard to the

20

Sacramento documents to link it to the system.

21

simply no basis to suggest that that supports any

22

evidence of a --

23

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

There is

So, Counsel, you heard

24

complaint counsel argue that the case is about more

25

than just electronic security and more than just

39
1

computer security and also includes physical security.

2

I take it you take issue with that?

3
4

MR. LECHNER:

Well, sure, I do.

There's nothing

in the complaint that says that.

5

I mean, we've been looking at a situation here

6

that's been changing with the filing of that complaint

7

right to the very moment now.

8

there's been testimony that at least there's one period

9

of time from June of 2007 to May of 2008 is the relevant

10

period, then we were told I believe it was 2005 to 2010,

11

that six-year period, and now we're told it's a

12

twelve-year period from 2005 to 2016.

13

target.

14

Now we're told, although

It's a moving

Dr. Hill has testified unequivocally.

She

15

offered no testimony beyond 2010.

16

suggest anything beyond 2010.

17

not supported in the record and argues off the record

18

and off the complaint.

19

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

There is nothing to

To expand it is simply

Is it possible that the

20

Sacramento documents came from any other source other

21

than LabMD?

22

MR. LECHNER:

23

from.

24

where they came from.

25

that.

I don't know where they could come

There's been no evidence.

I can't speculate

It's not my burden to disprove

It's their burden to prove it, and they haven't

40
1

offered any evidence, other than speculation, which

2

really I think is the key to their case.

3

speculation.

4

It's

They -- I believe it was Commissioner Ohlhausen

5

who asked whether a likelihood of substantial injury, if

6

that's established, or a likelihood of raising a

7

concrete harm, the possibility of concrete harm, equals

8

an injury.

9

read it in the brief -- they argue it does.

10

That makes

no sense.

11
12

And if I heard correctly -- and I think I

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Okay.

Tell us what the

appropriate legal standard is.

13

MR. LECHNER:

Well, I can tell you what the

14

statute says, and then we can talk about where they fell

15

short.

16

The statute is clear, Section 5(n) is clear that the

17

Commission cannot find something unreasonable unless --

18

that word "unless" is prominent -- it finds that there

19

was a harm that was caused in the past or likely that

20

the conduct would cause substantial injury.

21

“Likely to cause substantial injury” is

22

prospective - in the future.

23

There's no question about that.

24
25

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

“Likely” equals probable.
It is not ambiguous.

Let me start with the

actual harm prong of the unfairness standard.

41
1

MR. LECHNER:

2

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

3

here?

Sure.
Isn't there actual harm

Isn't the exposure of the 1718 File itself harm?

4

MR. LECHNER:

Exposure to whom?

5

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

6

MR. LECHNER:

To, at a minimum, Tiversa.

Well, Tiversa stole it, and they

7

tried to monetize it and they lied.

8

question that the people from Tiversa lied, except for

9

Wallace, but the Commission has tried to backpedal

10
11
12

There's no

away -CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Well, Tiversa didn't steal

the document; correct?

13

MR. LECHNER:

Well, they broke --

14

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

15

MR. LECHNER:

16

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Hold on.

I'm sorry.
Tiversa accessed the

17

document via a peer-to-peer program that permits sharing

18

of files; isn't that true?

19

MR. LECHNER:

Well, I'm not sure about that.

20

They were talking about using their Eagle Eye (sic)

21

program to break into it, which is supposed to be a lot

22

more sophisticated than normal peer-to-peer.

23

But in any event, they were not authorized.

24

They broke into it, and they broke into it for one

25

purpose, to try to blackmail the people that they broke

42
1

into, in this instance LabMD, to paying them money.

2

And when they didn't, then they partnered up with the

3

FTC and tried to have the FTC do their dirty work, as

4

Boback talked about, wait until you see what happens

5

next.

6

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

Counsel, let me ask

7

you, assume that we agree with you that Tiversa was a

8

bad actor.

9

MR. LECHNER:

10

Yes.

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

How are we to evaluate

11

LabMD's data security practices that enabled this bad

12

actor to obtain sensitive information about patients?

13

MR. LECHNER:

Well, there's no testimony, no

14

expert testimony, to establish that that in point of

15

fact is what happened.

16

You talk about many times, as the Chairwoman

17

mentioned, what is the standard.

18

as was pointed out, changes.

19

memorandum of law dismissing our motion to dismiss, you

20

pointed out that this is a rapidly changing technology.

21

Well, the standard,

And in your own

So when Dr. Hill testified, she did not offer

22

any testimony as to what the standard was from time to

23

time.

24

2005 to 2010, yet there was no basis, no benchmark, if

25

you will, as that term was used here this morning.

And we know that these standards changed from

But

43
1

there has to be that in order to demonstrate, number

2

one --

3

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So the use of strong

4

passwords, you don't think that that was established as

5

of 2005 or 2010?

6

Is that what your position is?

MR. LECHNER:

Well, I think we're looking at in

7

retrospect right now what we know eleven to twelve years

8

later as to the strength of these passwords.

9

you go on a commercial site and you open up a site -- if

10

And when

I could just --

11

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

12

MR. LECHNER:

Go ahead.

I'm sorry -- they sometimes open

13

back and say this is strong or this is weak, this

14

password.

15

can -- you could pick out one or two of these things and

16

say, in my view, this was not strong, but what

17

Professor Hill did not do is establish how that standard

18

was deviated from at the time in question from time to

19

time during that six-year period, and that's just one

20

instance there.

21

They did not do it back in 2005.

But you

They had the obligation to prove that.

These --

22

these allegations here have to be proved by expert

23

testimony.

24

Commission that they see something that they don't

25

like, and therefore there's a problem, and therefore

It can't be an ipse dixit from the

44
1

there's a harm.

2

speculation.

3

This is speculation based upon

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

So, Counsel, you're saying

4

that you looked at the standard of reasonableness at the

5

time that LabMD was operating under its various security

6

choices there, so you're not looking from the ten-year

7

vantage point back but at the time.

8

MR. LECHNER:

Yes.

9

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

You're saying that

10

there's no expert testimony or no information about what

11

would have been reasonable data security practices in

12

2005; is that correct?

13

MR. LECHNER:

With regard to --

14

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

15

MR. LECHNER:

16

And another point, just as an aside for one

Or 2005 to 2010.

That's precisely what I'm saying.

17

moment just to support that, more than thirty times,

18

more than thirty times, Professor Hill was asked if she

19

formed an opinion about, for example, X or Y.

20

Professor Hill said, "Yes."

21

thirty times was:

22

responded, "My conclusion is."

23

incompetent and can't be considered.

The next question more than

"What was your conclusion?"

She

That testimony is

45
1

Case law is clear that an expert cannot offer

2

legal conclusions.

3

was wrapped up at the end of this testimony when the

4

professor was asked, Based upon all -- on all of your

5

opinions, do you have a conclusion -- conclusion?

6

Excuse me.

7

then she offered that conclusion.

8
9
10

Yes.

That is for the trier of fact.

What was it?

That

My conclusion is, and

That testimony, frankly, is wrong.

The counsel

was warned about that by the ALJ right in the middle of
that testimony and continued along those lines.

11

But to go back to the absence of the standards

12

here, in not one place does Professor Hill talk about a

13

deviation from established standard and how that

14

standard changed from time to time to time, and we have

15

a six-year period when the standards are changing, as

16

was pointed out by the Commission in their order

17

dismissing the motion to dismiss.

18

there's no --

19

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

That's a given, yet

Don't LabMD's own policies

20

with regard to its network security tell us something

21

about what was considered reasonable at the time?

22

MR. LECHNER:

Well, yes.

There was a policy

23

there that these computers were not to be used for

24

personal use basis.

25

ESPN.

They couldn't go on and look at

They couldn't go on and use it for --

46
1

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

And you don't think it

2

would be reasonable for a company to have some form of

3

monitoring to ensure that those policies were followed?

4

MR. LECHNER:

Well, there was testimony that

5

there was monitoring there, but that's the question,

6

why -- and there was no opinion as to what was wrong

7

with that monitoring compared to what the baseline was

8

from time to time to time.

9

There's just a broad brush.

There's no attempt

10

to segregate this and look at it from period to period,

11

nor to look at it from whether paragraph 10(a) or right

12

through paragraph 10(g) and break it out seriatim as

13

each of those moved on from year to year to year.

14

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

Let me just back up

15

because I am confused about this argument that there were

16

no standards in place during this period of time that

17

you could follow.

18

MR. LECHNER:

I'm sorry?

19

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

Aren’t we talking

20

about HIPAA-covered documents, medical records, and

21

hopefully state standards here as well?

22

MR. LECHNER:

Well, that's just the point.

23

Professor Hill said she was not familiar with HIPAA.

24

Professor Hill did not link any standard to this industry

25

in particular or to this business in particular, and the

47
1

reasonableness demands both.

2

You cannot use a broad brush with regard to the

3

industry in general.

4

security industry?

5

Or is it the industry of the accumulation of medical

6

data for legitimate purposes, as LabMD was involved in?

7

What industry would it be?

The

Would it be the computer industry?

But that's another point that was not done

8

here.

There are no base standards with regard to the

9

particular company involved.

And as the Commission

10

pointed out, that's what has to be done in order to look

11

at what reasonableness is.

12

circumstances.

13

It's based upon the

What are the circumstances?

The company in

14

question, the size of it, what it does, how it does it,

15

what its business involved, and over what period of time

16

are we looking at it and how did those standards

17

change.

18

There was no testimony at even the basic

19

that the standards remained the same the whole time.

20

And I think it was acknowledged, again to go

21

back to your order on the motion to dismiss, that this

22

technology is rapidly changing, if not day to day, at

23

least much more quickly than one would expect.

24
25

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Well, what I think the

Commission stated in its decision was that it's a

48
1

company's obligation to be constantly evaluating its

2

risks and placing appropriate security measures in

3

order to protect the information that's contained, so

4

that's the question that we're trying to determine,

5

whether LabMD did that, correct, so --

6

MR. LECHNER:

And my point is, Madam Chair, is

7

that that's not my obligation to prove.

My obligation

8

is to disprove I had notice of it, but there's no

9

testimony establishing what the standard was that we

10

deviated from from time to time with regard to each of

11

these particulars.

12

was offered to each of these areas but not an opinion

13

based upon a reasonable degree of probability.

14

There was general conclusion that

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Can any conclusion be drawn

15

from the existence of LimeWire on the LabMD network?

16

Does that tell us anything about the reasonableness of

17

the data security practices?

18

MR. LECHNER:

Well, it's interesting.

The

19

position of this body was that P2P networking and

20

programs were neutral.

21

of a Congressional commission in July of 2007, that P2P

22

file sharing is neutral technology.

23

That was testified to in front

After that, the FTC position didn't change until

24

after 2008, and the FTC didn't give any notice of

25

warning businesses about the so-called dangers of P2P

49
1

until after it commenced the action against LabMD in

2

January 2010, so even the FTC's conduct here --

3

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

I've taken a look at that

4

testimony.

5

I understood that the agency in fact was educating both

6

consumers and businesses at that time about the risks,

7

the potential risks, of peer-to-peer technology, and

8

encouraged businesses to evaluate those risks.

9
10

I don't read it the way that you do, and so

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

Let me frame that question

slightly differently, if I may.

11

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Go ahead.

12

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

Is the existence of

13

unsanctioned, undetected software that was installed by

14

an employee on a computer something that we should take

15

into account in assessing whether reasonable security

16

practices were in place?

17

MR. LECHNER:

By itself, no.

It doesn't mean

18

anything.

19

has to be done here -- just for argument sake, let's

20

just take that proposition as a given.

21

then the question is:

22

answer is no here.

23

was caused.

24

cause substantial injury.

25

Because, number one, there's been no -- what

All right?

Did that cause any harm?

But

The

There's no allegation that any harm

The allegation is that it was likely to

Now, there's no testimony with regard to the

50
1

probability of that -- assume for argument position --

2

was likely to cause substantial injury.

3

Now, if you wanted to use the new standard that

4

they are trying to allege now after the fact that they

5

did not allege until after their post-trial briefing that

6

we should read likely to cause substantial injury as

7

likely to raise a substantial risk of -- risk of

8

substantial -- of a concrete harm, that's even more

9

difficult to prove, because then you need expert

10

testimony of the likelihood that it's going to cause it,

11

what -- what the risk is, how the risk increased from

12

what to what, and we --

13

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Counsel, if I may, and

14

just going back to this issue of what one can infer

15

from just even the existence of the LimeWire program

16

being placed on a computer, there is testimony from

17

Mr. -- Dr. Shields about the ease with which someone

18

could access files that have been made accessible via

19

peer-to-peer programs.

20

showing that that creates a risk of exposure of

21

sensitive information?

22
23
24
25

MR. LECHNER:

Isn't that evidence

Well, first of all, the LimeWire

was taken off promptly, as you know, back in 2008.
There's no testimony from him as to what period
of time he's talking about.

We are just using this block

51
1

of time.

2

cannot look at this as a monolithic block with standards

3

not changing.

4

Again, I go back to the same position that you

And third of all, it's speculative because

5

there's not one incident either from the Sacramento

6

documents nor one incident from the documents that were

7

taken by Tiversa without authority that anyone saw these

8

documents except Tiversa, and they gave it to this

9

professor and the FTC, who gave it to experts.

10

Nobody

else saw this.

11

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

Counsel, we know that

12

Tiversa did access the file through peer-to-peer.

13

don't know whether anyone else did.

14

MR. LECHNER:

We

Is that correct?

Well, we do know this, that LabMD

15

had two of its employees use their home computers and

16

tried repeatedly to use file-sharing programs and were

17

not able to locate it.

18

That's in the record.

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

But can you explain

19

why they weren't able to determine that from the

20

hard drive with the forensic audit?

21

MR. LECHNER:

I don't know.

22

burden.

23

that, which is again --

24

I simply don't know.

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

That's not my

I can't speculate as to

What happened to that

52
1

computer?

It's unclear from the record what happened to

2

that computer.

3

MR. LECHNER:

4

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

5

I have no idea.
There's nothing in the

record about --

6

MR. LECHNER:

Not that I'm aware of.

7

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

And it's also, I think, not

8

totally clear what other files might have been

9

accessible through LimeWire on the computer. Is that

10
11

right?
MR. LECHNER:

Well, again, that's speculation.

12

You're correct.

13

factual testimony on that, no expert testimony on that,

14

rank speculation, yes, as far as that's concerned.

15

That's total speculation.

There's no

But to go back to the standard that's involved

16

here, we do have a migration of this right now from

17

likely to cause substantial injury to likely to raise a

18

significant risk of concrete harm.

19

that if you're going to use the second one, you need an

20

expert witness to opine as to what "likely" would mean,

21

what "substantial" and what "risk" means and what

22

"concrete harm" means.

I suggest to you

23

Concrete harm certainly, as -- if you look at

24

the footnote in the fairness statement, does not mean

25

anything that could -- if somebody feels bad or has an

53
1

emotional problem.

"Concrete" means, what has been

2

decided in every case that's been brought so far, an

3

actual injury, monetary injury.

4

Now, I'm not suggesting that you have to have

5

an actual injury to have a violation of 5(n), but you

6

need to prove -- and it's in the disjunctive -- either

7

the actual injury causes or it's likely to cause

8

substantial risk of concrete harm or raise that, so you

9

need that benchmark in there.

10

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

So is it your position

11

then under Section 5(n) that complaint counsel has to

12

establish the precise calculable risk of injury?

13

MR. LECHNER:

What counsel has to do, just like

14

in the tort field, as this Commission has recognized,

15

this is an evolving standard, as is done in -- for

16

contracts and for torts, likewise here, too, that even

17

though there are no articulated standards per se out

18

there, that there would be testimony that would be

19

offered that this is the standard, that there's a

20

deviation from the standard, as a result of that

21

deviation that harm has been caused.

22

day in medical malpractice cases.

23

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

You see that every

So you're not saying that

24

complaint counsel would have to show that there was a

25

52.3 percent --

54
1

MR. LECHNER:

They have to show a probability.

2

No, I'm not suggesting it has to be numerical, but it

3

has to be probable.

4
5

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:
mean?

And what would "probable"

Would it mean --

6

MR. LECHNER:

More likely than not.

7

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

So if a practice has a

8

25 percent probability of resulting in a loss of a

9

million dollars --

10

MR. LECHNER:

11

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

12

-- that wouldn't be

expected to be likely to cause substantial injury?

13
14

That's not probable.

MR. LECHNER:

That would be possible.

That

would not be probable.

15

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

And then how does that

16

square with, say, for example, International Harvester,

17

where the Commission interpreted --

18

MR. LECHNER:

Well, that case is

19

distinguishable.

20

case.

21

entirely different from this case where there are none.

22

There were actual injuries in that

There were actual injuries in that case.

That's

In that case, there were actual injuries, and

23

they were talking about it in light of those actual

24

injuries there, so that probability was not required

25

there because you had an actual injury.

55
1
2

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

"likely" means has to be probable.

3
4

MR. LECHNER:

And that's what the case law says.

Absolutely.

5
6

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

MR. LECHNER:

8

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

No.

MR. LECHNER:

11

of probable.

12

Eleventh Circuit --

13

Because likely is the equivalent

You look up any case in the

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So what cases are you

relying on?

15

MR. LECHNER:

16

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

17

Then why doesn’t it say

"probable"?

10

14

But wouldn't you say that

at least the statute is ambiguous on that?

7

9

So you're saying that

I'm sorry?
What cases are you relying

on when you say that --

18

MR. LECHNER:

Oh, I can get you the cases.

19

can make that representation to you.

20

fact that likely is the substantial equivalent of

21

probable.

22

not.

23

impossible.

24
25

I

I know that as a

Likely and probable means more likely than

It does not mean possible.

Possible means not

Likely means more likely than not.

And that's the question for the trier of fact,
does it come to that?

I am not suggesting that there

56
1

must be a numerical grade attached to this.

2

expert has to testify that in her opinion, it's more

3

likely than not or probable that as a result of this

4

conduct, there is a chance of -- or, rather, a risk of

5

increased -- of substantial injury.

6

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

No.

So what do we make of the

7

unfairness statement's discussion of avoiding

8

speculative injuries?

9
10

MR. LECHNER:

The

Well, that's just it.

That's why

it has to be probable.

11

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

So you say that if

12

something is nonspeculative, it means it has to be --

13

have a greater than 50 percent chance of occurring.

14

MR. LECHNER:

Yes.

And that's what the case law

15

says.

16

about, whether it's medical malpractice, architectural

17

malpractice --

18
19
20

That's what every case law in negligence talks

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

But we're not

interpreting negligence torts here; right?
MR. LECHNER:

But my point is, you used the

21

example of this standard evolving the same way the

22

definition of negligence has evolved, the same way

23

negligence standards have evolved.

24

opinion in dismissing the motion to dismiss, that that

25

is an evolutionary process.

That's part of your

57
1

And because this Commission has not issued

2

standards -- and issuing standards is a long process.

3

There's public comment.

4

from the industry.

5

on.

People read it.

You get input

People are aware of what's going

6

So the courts have allowed, in lieu of that, to

7

have this evolutionary process in the courts as to what

8

this would be, and that's what you have articulated in

9

the motion to dismiss.

10
11

This is an evolutionary

process.
Now, to have that process move along absent

12

standards, there has to be some gradual

13

determination as to what happens from case to case

14

because, as you've said, it is a case-by-case

15

development.

16

In order to have that, there has to be the

17

establishment of standards for the period of time, for

18

the company in question, for the industry, and if that

19

period of time varies over a number of years, at least

20

the testimony that it's the same standard for all these

21

years or how it's changed, that there's a deviation from

22

that standard, and it's because of that deviation, as is

23

in this case, more likely than not or probable that that

24

conduct that has been called to be unreasonable has

25

increased the risk of substantial harm.

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

Can I focus on a period of

2

time here for just a second, because I am a little

3

confused about what period of time we're talking about.

4

In your brief, you focus, I think, on the 2007 to

5

2008 time frame.

6

2005 to 2010.

7

still have a lot of sensitive information and some

8

ongoing issues, in their view, surrounding how that

9

information is being protected.

10

Dr. Hill's testimony focuses on

Complaint counsel has mentioned that you

What steps is LabMD taking at this point

11

to ensure that highly sensitive information

12

is being protected? And in your view, what is the

13

relevant period of time that we should be considering?

14

MR. LECHNER:

Well, it's my understanding that

15

LabMD is out of business now.

16

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

17

amount of patient information.

18

MR. LECHNER:

But it still has a huge

I don't know how much it has left,

19

but it's not doing business right now as a result of the

20

expense and the problems with this case.

21

That's one of the problems.

You know, when the

22

Commission brings something like this, a lot of these

23

cases end up --

24
25

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:
a second.

Let's back up for just

59
1

MR. LECHNER:

2

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

3
4

I'm sorry?
What is the relevant

period of time?
MR. LECHNER:

The relevant period -- I'm sorry.

5

The relevant period of time I'd suggest to this body is

6

May of 2007 to -- June of 2007 to May of 2008.

7

I know that there's testimony offered to

8

through 2010, but there is absolutely nothing beyond

9

2010 other than rank speculation and argument.

10

At worst

for us it's to 2010.

11

But more precisely, it's to 2008 because the

12

Sacramento documents are a red herring in this case.

13

And the only thing that we're talking about here is the

14

1718 File, which there is no testimony that it was

15

viewed by anybody other than Tiversa, Tiversa's

16

professor I think in Dartmouth, the FTC and the people

17

to whom the FTC gave it.

18

this case.

19

That's the only testimony in

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

But doesn't that go back

20

to the idea that you have to show actual harm versus

21

likely harm?

22

MR. LECHNER:

Yes.

Well, that's the point.

You

23

can either show actual harm, and if you can't show that,

24

we'll concede that the alternative, the "or" in the

25

disjunctive there, you know, that the alleged

60
1

unreasonable conduct likely increased the risk of

2

substantial injury or they're trying to cause now

3

concrete injury.

4

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

And what about the idea

5

that exposing someone's private health information for a

6

stigmatizing condition is in itself a harm?

7

MR. LECHNER:

8

can't be.

9

in that.

10

That just can't be because there's no injury
There's no substantial injury, as you talked

about.

11
12

You know, that by itself, that

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

But going to the

unfairness statement --

13

MR. LECHNER:

Yes.

14

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

-- it says,

15

generally it's monetary harm, but there could

16

be in some circumstances the type of harm that would be

17

if you can show that it would lead to some sort

18

of actual injury.

19

MR. LECHNER:

20

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

21

something like that.

22

MR. LECHNER:

Right.

And that's what they -Like harassment or

That's what they would have to

23

show.

They haven't showed anybody has even complained,

24

number one, about this, much more that anybody has

25

viewed these documents other than people I've mentioned,

61
1

much more that anybody suffered any harassment or any

2

other type of soft injury.

3

Everything is total speculation.

4

There's been nothing here.

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

But what if they showed

5

that exposing this type of information leads -- likely

6

leads to those kinds of harms?

7

MR. LECHNER:

8

Look at the expert testimony of Kam and

9

Van Dyke.

But they haven't shown that.

They used surveys five years after the fact

10

trying to extrapolate backwards, relying on Boback

11

testimony extensively.

12

wrong.

13

That methodology is completely

That methodology can't be relied upon.
There's nothing there to demonstrate, even on

14

the basis that you folks have established in some of

15

your cases, that the methodology is the first thing that

16

would have to be looked at.

17

by either Kam or Van Dyke.

18

There was none in this case

And Professor Hill explicitly testified that she

19

was assuming harm.

20

was told to assume harm, so there's nothing from

21

Professor Hill on that either.

22
23
24
25

She didn't opine as to harm.

She

There is an absence of proof in this case, an
utter absence of proof in this case.
COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

It's speculative.

If more than Tiversa, the

FTC and the various investigators had viewed the

62
1

1718 File, would that be harm?

2

MR. LECHNER:

Well, I don't know.

It would

3

depend on the circumstances, as you point out.

4

circumstances in a particular case on a case-by-case

5

development have to be considered.

6

that the trial court would have had to consider, but in

7

this case there was nothing for him to consider.

8

pointed out, there was a total failure of proof in this

9

case.

10

Nobody else looked at it.

All the

And that's something

As he

After all these

11

years, after all of these years, not one person has come

12

forward.

13

and Mr. Van Dyke talked about, the percentages there,

14

not once after seven years has anybody come -- and they

15

were talking about that percentage of each of those

16

instances within twelve months.

17

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

Even taking what Professor Kam -- or Mr. Kam

Counsel, does your

18

interpretation of Section 5(n) agree with the

19

Third Circuit's interpretation in Wyndham?

20

MR. LECHNER:

Well, it seems to me that's

21

entirely different because there was concrete harm,

22

millions of dollars was run up, and they didn't really

23

focus on what we're focusing on here, so to say that

24

is --

25

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

But you're saying the

63
1

facts are different, but I'm asking you whether their

2

interpretation of the statute is correct.

3

MR. LECHNER:

I don't recall exactly what they

4

said, but I think they recognized that the FTC has the

5

obligation to prove, in the disjunctive, either actual

6

harm or likelihood of increased risk of concrete harm,

7

if you want to use that secondary standard, which is a

8

deviation from the statute, or likely to cause

9

substantial harm in the future.

10

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

So the Wyndham court

11

talks about the probability and expected size of

12

reasonably unavoidable harms to consumers given a

13

certain level of cybersecurity and the costs to

14

consumers that would arise from an investment in

15

stronger cybersecurity, so they're talking about the

16

cost-benefit analysis and considered a number

17

of factors.

18
19
20

So the probability and expected size, how
does -MR. LECHNER:

They're talking about

21

probabilities there and they're talking about looking at

22

all of the circumstances.

23

company, the timing, the variations from time to time,

24

all that is part of the circumstances.

25

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

All the circumstances, the

But aren't you also

64
1

saying that if there isn't a showing that there was an

2

actual harm that there's no violation?

3

MR. LECHNER:

No, no, no, I'm not saying that at

4

all.

5

actual harm or they can show a likelihood that would

6

cause a substantial injury.

7

I'm saying it's in the disjunctive.

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

They can show

And if I recall

8

correctly, you're saying that that likelihood has to be

9

greater than 50 percent.

10

MR. LECHNER:

Well, it has to be more probable

11

than not, yes.

And by every definition that you've

12

looked at in every case, probability means more than

13

50 percent.

14

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

15

MR. LECHNER:

In unfairness cases?

Well, if you're going to use the

16

word "probability," it can't -- you can't have a

17

10 percent chance of something happening and to say

18

that's probable, especially in light of the fact of the

19

recognition of this Commission that because those

20

standards were not issued, it's going to be a

21

case-by-case development, we're going to use the

22

protocol that's used in the case and in the courts of

23

this country, and invariably, in every single court, it

24

has never been sustained that the plaintiff has proved

25

his or her case without demonstrating a probability of

65
1

a cause -- of the injury being caused by the defendant.

2

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So, Counsel, just to make

3

sure that I'm clear as to your position, we do know

4

that the record does establish, the evidence does

5

establish, that LimeWire was on the computer in LabMD's

6

network from approximately 2005 through May of 2007;

7

correct?

8

MR. LECHNER:

Yes.

9

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

And we do also know that

10

the 1718 File was within the files that were accessible

11

via this peer-to-peer program; correct?

12

MR. LECHNER:

Well, I wonder --

13

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

14

MR. LECHNER:

Is that correct?

Well, I just want to challenge

15

that.

I'm not sure it's peer-to-peer.

16

Eagle Eye (sic) program.

17

without a difference.

18

It was their

Maybe that's a distinction

I don't know.

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

May I just clarify?

19

think it was on the computer until May of 2008.

20

correct?

21

MR. LECHNER:

Yes.

Yes, you're right.

Yes.

I

Is that

It was an eleven-month

22

period.

June of 2007 to May of

23

2008, the eleven-month period, yes.

24

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

25

MR. LECHNER:

So that is correct; right?

It was on there, yes.

Yes.

66
1

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

And are you saying that

2

the availability of Social Security information as well

3

as sensitive medical information on a peer-to-peer --

4

through a peer-to-peer program, that that itself is not

5

either actual harm or likely to cause substantial harm?

6

MR. LECHNER:

That's absolutely what I'm saying,

7

because if that were the case, there would be no reason

8

for this trial.

9

Commission through its complaint counsel would have

10

There would be no reason.

The

moved for summary judgment.

11

As you recognized, there were issues here, there

12

were fact issues, there were issues with regard to the

13

expert testimony here.

14

there does not mean by definition it equals an injury.

15

If there's --

16

The mere fact that something is

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So in your view,

17

complaint counsel had to establish access, that someone

18

accessed that file other than Mr. Wallace, in order to

19

show -- to prevail and show liability here; is that

20

right?

21

MR. LECHNER:

They would have had to

22

demonstrate through expert testimony that it was more

23

likely than not that that one incident itself was

24

unreasonable and therefore that it was likely to cause

25

substantial injury in the future, which they didn't do.

67
1

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

2

incident; right?

3

period of --

4
5

Well, if you want to call that,

The eleven-month period, yes.

6

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

7

MR. LECHNER:

8

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

9

Well, it's not an

It's this file was available for a

MR. LECHNER:
yes.

Okay.

Yes.

-- eleven months.
I agree.
Let me turn to the parts of

the unfairness standard, and let's just assume for

10

purposes of argument -- I know that you take issue with

11

this -- that complaint counsel has established either

12

actual harm or a likelihood of substantial injury.

13

Tell me what your position is about the other

14

prongs of the unfairness standard, that is, whether such

15

harm was reasonably -- would have been reasonably

16

avoidable by consumers or whether it was outweighed by

17

countervailing benefits to either consumers or

18

competition.

19

MR. LECHNER:

Well, as you know, in this case

20

it wasn't addressed because the judge found that there

21

was no injury established or -- and they did not

22

establish a likelihood of substantial injury in the

23

future.

24

under the statute under 5(n) those other two prongs

25

would have to be addressed.

But if that were established, then clearly

But those other two prongs

68
1

are dependent upon the existence of a harm or the

2

likelihood of harm.

3

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So the ALJ -- you're

4

correct, the ALJ did not address those issues in his

5

opinion, but are there -- is there anything in the

6

record on those points?

7

MR. LECHNER:

8

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

9

Not that I -Is it your position that

consumers could have done something to alleviate any

10

unreasonable data security practices on LabMD's

11

network?

12
13

MR. LECHNER:

I don't

know.

14
15

I can't address that.

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

You don’t know, not one way or the

other?

16

MR. LECHNER:

No.

17

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

18

MR. LECHNER:

Anything further, Counsel?

Well, let me just really quickly,

19

if I may, just look at my notes just to be sure that I

20

was able to cover the points I wanted to hit.

21

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

I do want to circle back

22

on one aspect here -- I understand you

23

don't know what information the company currently has,

24

but should I be concerned about how we can

25

ensure, absent an order, that sensitive information is

69
1

appropriately protected?

2

MR. LECHNER:

3

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

4

Well, you know, of course, the --

the time frame that you put forward.

5

MR. LECHNER:

6

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

7
8

Assuming I disagree with

I'm sorry?
I said, assuming that I

disagree with the time frame that you put forward.
MR. LECHNER:

This Commission can offer

9

guidelines, can offer standards, can establish guides

10

along those lines here, but may I respectfully suggest

11

this is not the case to do it because there's not the

12

factual foundation to do it.

13

My colleague gave me -- if you want the cites to

14

the cases I talked about that likelihood is synonymous

15

with probability, I can give it to you.

16

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

17

MR. LECHNER:

Please.

In re Terazosin Hydrochloride

18

Antitrust Litigation, 352 F.2d 1279, the word

19

"likelihood" is synonymous with "probability," citing

20

Shatel Corporation versus Mao Ta Lumber & Yacht,

21

697 F.2d 1352, Eleventh Circuit, 1983.

22

Again, in defining the word "probability," the

23

Eleventh Circuit has recognized that it is capable of

24

two definitions, a lower "reasonable probability"

25

standard or a higher "more likely than not" standard.

70
1

But ultimately, the definition that is most often cited

2

in the Eleventh Circuit precedent is the "more likely

3

than not" standard.

4

cites the Mercantile Tex. Corporation, 638 F.2d 1255,

5

Fifth Circuit, 1981; U.S. v. Marine Bancorp,

6

418 U.S. 602 (1974).

7

And it talks about there that it deals in probabilities,

8

not ephemeral probabilities (sic), quoting Brown Shoe,

9

370 U.S. 292 at 1962.

10

And that goes back to Terazosin and

That deals with the Clayton Act.

In either incident, the trial counsel --

11

complaint counsel -- excuse me -- in this case has not

12

carried the burden.

13

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

Just let me clarify.

The

14

cases you were just citing are tort cases, a Clayton Act

15

case --

16

MR. LECHNER:

I'm sorry?

17

COMMISSIONER McSWEENY:

18

MR. LECHNER:

These are tort cases --

Well, one is a tort case, the

19

other are commercial cases, so I've tried to cover both,

20

yes.

21

my understanding, yes, so...

22

One is antitrust, and the other are tort cases, to

And I realize this is not a tort as we use that

23

word in medical malpractice or architectural

24

malpractice, but the concept is the same.

25

established standard, a deviation, both of which have to

There's an

71
1

be established on a basic -- on reasonable probability.

2

An expert cannot testify to speculation.

3

has to be an opinion that because of that deviation, an

4

injury or damage occurred, none of which have happened

5

in this case.

6

And then there

Again, I go back to the fact that Dr. Hill only

7

testified with regard to her conclusion.

She started

8

virtually every answer "It is my conclusion that."

9

That's simply not appropriate testimony, and I

10

respectfully suggest that it can't be considered as in

11

any way proof in this case.

12

If I could just have one second.

13

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

14

(Pause in the proceedings.)

15

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

16

Sure.

question.

17

MR. LECHNER:

18

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

19

Counsel, I have one more

I'm sorry?
I have another

question.

20

MR. LECHNER:

Sure.

21

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

So if complaint counsel

22

were to prove that or allege that the exposure of

23

medical information to an unauthorized third party was

24

substantial injury, so if they were to say that the

25

fact that LabMD's data security practices exposed the

72
1

1718 File to an unauthorized third party, which I think

2

is shown in the record, why isn't that substantial

3

injury?

4

MR. LECHNER:

Well, if you look at all the

5

circumstances, it was exposed to Tiversa, which is not

6

a -- I assume, and there's nothing in the record to

7

suggest that it is, that it is an identity theft user of

8

these files.

9
10

Now, for argument sake, if we want to speculate
that suppose there was proof that --

11

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

But let's say, for

12

example, even if it wasn't for identity theft, they

13

had the information about people's private medical

14

medical diagnoses.

15

itself?

16

Is that not an injury in

MR. LECHNER:

I don't see how it is.

17

it's a soft injury.

18

It's not a concrete harm.

19

I see that

It's not a substantial injury.

And the Commission through its counsel has been

20

arguing that the standard they want to look at now is

21

that it's likely that it raises the risk of concrete

22

harm.

23

somebody has looked at one of my documents.

24

mean to sound callous on that.

25

Concrete harm is not, gee, I feel bad because
And I don't

But to go back to what you had asked before,

73
1

Commissioner, if there were proof that there were a

2

series of identity thieves that through their sites had

3

downloaded this, I think it might be a little bit more

4

easy with appropriate expert testimony to establish

5

that, but there is nothing here to suggest that.

6

Frankly, there's nothing here to suggest that

7

anyone read these documents other than the FTC and its

8

experts and perhaps that professor to whom Tiversa gave

9

it.

10

So to suggest this is really rank speculation on

11

rank speculation.

12

what we're constrained to look at right now.

13
14

Based on the facts of this case is

If there's nothing further, I thank you for your
time.

15

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

16

Ms. VanDruff, you used up all of your time, but

17
18
19

Thank you, Counsel.

I know that you had reserved time for rebuttal, so -MS. VANDRUFF:

How would you like me to proceed,

Madam Chairwoman?

20

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

21

MS. VANDRUFF:

22

Respondent's counsel raised a number of issues

Okay.

Why don't you go ahead.
Thank you.

23

that I'd like to address in, unfortunately, no

24

particular order, if it pleases the Commission.

25

At the outset, respondent's counsel identified

74
1

Eagle Vision as something that was of particular

2

interest because it was sophisticated technology.

3

would just observe that that is something that is not in

4

the record except through the testimony of Mr. Boback, a

5

witness that the Administrative Law Judge found not to

6

be credible and a witness upon whom complaint counsel is

7

not relying.

8
9

And I

And in fact, his testimony was contradicted by
respondent's witness, Mr. Wallace, and that testimony

10

can be found at complaint counsel's finding of fact

11

1394.

12

1718 File using a stand-alone computer and ordinary P2P

13

software.

14

It was Mr. Wallace's testimony that he found the

And you'll forgive me that -- one of you on the

15

panel -- and I -- forgive me for not remembering

16

which -- asked what happened to the computer, and it

17

was respondent's counsel's response that it was

18

speculation.

19

in response to the question, I would direct the panel

20

to complaint counsel's finding of fact 1409, which

21

relates to the testimony of Mr. Daugherty, which

22

describes a forensic examination performed by LabMD and

23

what happened there.

24
25

But that's belied by the testimony.

LabMD is effectively out of business.
in fact true.

And

That is

But I think it's important for a variety

75
1

of reasons, including the relief that complaint counsel

2

is seeking, to note for the record that it intends to

3

resume operations -- it made that point clear in the

4

proceeding below -- and more importantly that when it

5

resumes operations, it intends to apply the same

6

protections to the data that it maintains for the

7

750,000 consumers.

8

finding of fact 61.

9

That is found at complaint counsel's

And that relates also to the question of what

10

protections it has provided to data since 2010, a

11

question that came up repeatedly during respondent

12

counsel's presentation.

13

demonstrates that LabMD's unlawful conduct again

14

continued after July of 2010.

15

And the weight of the evidence

I would direct the panel's consideration to

16

complaint counsel's responses to respondent's findings

17

of fact at paragraphs -- excuse me -- at findings 10(a)

18

and 11 but just as examples.

19

As recently as November of 2013, paper records

20

were stored in an unlocked, open garage at a personal

21

residence.

22

credentials, and critical vulnerabilities remained on

23

key servers after vulnerability scans were completed.

24
25

Key personnel were using weak user

Professor Hill's opinions don't support a
contrary conclusion.

76
1

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So, Counsel, let me

2

interrupt you and just get to some -- again go back to

3

some of the issues we already discussed with you but to

4

hone in on certain of the positions articulated by

5

respondent.

6

Respondent, as you know, argues that there

7

really is no benchmark here, that Dr. Hill did

8

not establish an appropriate measure by which to

9

determine that the practices were reasonable or

10

unreasonable, so what in the record should we be

11

looking to in addition to -- you dispute that about

12

Dr. Hill I know, but what else should we be looking to

13

in the record to determine what the appropriate

14

standard to apply here to determine reasonableness of

15

LabMD's data security practices?

16

MS. VANDRUFF:

Well, again, the legal standard,

17

of course, is Section 5(n).

18

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

19

MS. VANDRUFF:

So I understand that.

So with respect to that

20

information security standard, in her expert report,

21

she cites to a number of things, including a NIST

22

guidance that goes back to 2002, which certainly

23

predates any of the conduct that's challenged in this

24

case.

25

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So I understand that.

77
1

MS. VANDRUFF:

2

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

3

MS. VANDRUFF:

4

I’m not sure what else is cited in her report

5

standing here, but I do believe that in her testimony

6

and in her report she cites to other materials that were

7

widely available and understood in the information

8

security --

9

Yes.
What else?

Yes.

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

So another argument that

10

respondent makes is that one needs to factor in the

11

size of the operations of respondent, and is there any

12

information about the cost of the reasonable security

13

measures that you contend should have been utilized by

14

LabMD?

15

MS. VANDRUFF:

There is, yes.

And

16

Professor Hill, her opinions and her testimony

17

addresses that.

18

recommends to safeguard the information that was at risk

19

of unauthorized disclosure were either at low or no cost

20

for LabMD to implement and would require low-cost

21

measures or staff time to have implemented.

22

And all of the measures that she

So, for example, the failure of LabMD to have

23

locked down computers, to have prevented employees from

24

downloading software from the Internet, all that would

25

have required was limiting administrative access.

78
1

That's something that is available -- that the IT staff

2

could have done using a function through Windows, and it

3

just would have required staff time to have enabled that

4

function through Windows.

5
6

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:
you.

7

MS. VANDRUFF:

8

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

9

A couple more questions for

Yes, Madam Chairwoman.
Respondent also argues

that there is no evidence in the record that addresses

10

the other elements of the unfairness standard aside

11

from the question of injury, so can you tell me what is

12

in the record on reasonable avoidance as well as

13

countervailing benefits?

14
15

MS. VANDRUFF:

Yes.

I would be happy to address

that.

16

The record establishes that consumers could not

17

have reasonably avoided the significant risk of

18

concrete harm that we have described at length this

19

afternoon.

20

knowing that LabMD would receive their personal

21

information, much less any way of knowing --

22
23
24
25

In most cases, consumers had no way of

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:
this?

And where do I look for

Is this also in -MS. VANDRUFF:

physician practices.

Yes.

The testimony of the

I regret that I cannot cite them to

79
1

you, but my colleague can (indicating).

2

No.

This is the low-cost measures.

Excuse me.

3

The testimony of the physician practices

4

demonstrates that consumers did not know that their

5

information was going to LabMD, that that was a

6

decision made by their physicians.

7

consumers had no reason to know of the data security

8

practices that LabMD undertook because they didn't even

9

know that their data was going to LabMD.

10

And moreover,

And as suggested by your earlier question, the

11

fact that LabMD's data security failures could have been

12

remedied at little or no cost, their failures,

13

therefore, did not provide any countervailing benefits to

14

consumers or competition; therefore, the remaining

15

prongs of Section 5(n) are met.

16
17
18

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

One final question at my

end that relates to the Sacramento documents.
So respondent -- counsel for respondent argues

19

that we are limited to the allegations that are set

20

forth in the complaint.

21

paragraph 10 that outlines data security practices with

22

regards to LabMD's computer network.

23

In particular, I believe it's

Tell me why counsel for respondent is incorrect

24

in that regard, that we're not limited to the

25

allegations in the complaint.

80
1

MS. VANDRUFF:

Well, the allegations in

2

paragraph 10, again, are among other things.

3

examples of failures of reasonable security, and so I

4

think that the unfairness count is the gravamen of

5

the --

6

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

They are

Are there allegations in

7

the complaint that relate more broadly to physical

8

security in the complaint?

9

MS. VANDRUFF:

No.

But the allegations in

10

paragraph 10 are consistent with allegations of

11

physical security.

12

One point, before I move on from Sacramento,

13

Madam Chairwoman, the respondent's counsel did say that

14

it would be speculation about whether or not the

15

Sacramento documents were from LabMD.

16

of clarification, respondent's counsel earlier in the

17

litigation, before respondent -- before Mr. Lechner

18

joined the case, did stipulate that those documents were

19

in fact LabMD's documents, just as a matter of

20

clarification.

21
22

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

Counsel, I have a

question.

23

MS. VANDRUFF:

24

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

25

Just as a matter

Yes.
So in the unfairness

statement, mostly it talks about financial

81
1

injury, but it also says, "In an extreme case, however,

2

where tangible injury could clearly be demonstrated,

3

emotional effects might possibly be considered as the

4

basis for a finding of unfairness."

5

So what evidence is in the record that the

6

exposure of medical information about perhaps a

7

stigmatizing condition to an unauthorized third party is

8

substantial injury that it might cause this kind of

9

tangible injury?

10
11

MS. VANDRUFF:

May I have permission to respond

to Commissioner Ohlhausen's question?

12

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

13

MS. VANDRUFF:

Please.

The testimony of Mr. Kam

14

addresses that question.

He is an expert witness with

15

experience specifically in medical identity theft and

16

the harms that result from exposure of sensitive

17

medical information.

18

go to that question, and he describes the harms that

19

result from the exposure of sensitive medical

20

information and talks about exactly those kinds of

21

harms.

And his report and his testimony

22

COMMISSIONER OHLHAUSEN:

23

MS. VANDRUFF:

24

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

25

Okay.

Thank you.

You're welcome.
Is it necessary for there

to be actual harm for the information -- the medical

82
1

information that's exposed -- to be something that would be

2

potentially something that could stigmatize an

3

individual?

4

So let's just say the exposure has to do with

5

just routine blood tests.

6

constitute actual harm?

7
8
9

In your mind, would that

Or is that a question that we don't need to
address?
MS. VANDRUFF:

Well, it's a question that we

10

don't need to address in this case.

11

In the -- because in this case the information that was

12

disclosed included potentially stigmatizing

13

information.

14

That is certain.

In the GMR case, the Commission alleged that

15

the information that was disclosed, which included

16

narrative notes from -- from physicians, could be

17

misused to cause substantial injury such as identity

18

theft and unauthorized access by disclosing sensitive

19

private medical information.

20

all fours with GMR.

21

MR. LECHNER:

22

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

23

MR. LECHNER:

24
25

May I?

We think that this is on

I'm sorry.
Counsel?

May I have leave just to make one

or two points?
CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

Well, this is really out of

83
1

order, but given that we gave so much time to

2

Ms. VanDruff, I'll go ahead and allow you to make --

3

MR. LECHNER:

Just two brief points.

4

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

5

MS. VANDRUFF:

6

MR. LECHNER:

Sure.

Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
One point is that, to my

7

understanding, we did not stipulate that the Sacramento

8

documents came from our computer.

9

We did not.

And secondly and the last point is, the Kam

10

opinion is bad based upon its bad methodology.

11

Those are the only two points.

12

CHAIRWOMAN RAMIREZ:

13

Thank you very much.

14

We are adjourned.

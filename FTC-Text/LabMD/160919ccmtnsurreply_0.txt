COMPLAINT COUNSEL’S SURREPLY
IN RESPONSE TO RESPONDENT’S REPLY BRIEF
Complaint Counsel files this Surreply in response to Respondent LabMD, Inc.’s Reply to
Complaint Counsel’s Opposition to Respondent’s Application for Stay of Final Order Pending
Review by a United States Court of Appeals (“Respondent’s Reply Brief”). This Surreply is
necessary to address two issues in Respondent’s Reply Brief that could not have been raised in
Complaint Counsel’s response brief: (1) Respondent’s unfounded allegations of attorney
misconduct; and (2) Respondent’s improper attempt to supplement its Application for Stay in
violation of Rule 3.56(d), 16 C.F.R. § 3.56(d).
I.

RULES DEMAND BETTER THAN UNSUPPORTED AD HOMINEM ATTACKS
ON COUNSEL
Throughout this litigation, Respondent through its counsel has hurled specious,

unfounded, and irresponsible allegations regarding the character, motives, and conduct of
members of the Complaint Counsel team. See, e.g., Resp’t’s Mot. for Sanctions (Aug. 14, 2014)
(alleging misconduct by Complaint Counsel for its prosecution of the Complaint); Resp’t’s

PUBLIC
Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Sanctions (Sep. 2, 2014) (same); Order on Resp’t’s Unopp. Mot. for
Order Req. Richard Wallace to Testify Under Grant of Immunity Pursuant to Rule 3.39 (Oct. 9,
2014) at 5 (repeating Respondent’s counsel’s proffer of anticipated—but never realized—
testimony regarding Complaint Counsel’s putative misconduct); Resp’t’s Corrected Proposed
Findings of Fact ¶ 58 (Aug. 11, 2015) (deliberately suggesting, contrary to the record, that
Commission staff participated in a meeting with Tiversa staff that related to falsifying evidence).
Respondent’s Reply Brief is the latest and most egregious example of Respondent’s
tactic, leveling not only unsupported allegations of general misconduct, but specifically charging
that a member of the Complaint Counsel team “importun[ed] Tiversa to provide fraudulent
evidence of ‘spread’ regarding the 1718 File.” Reply Br. at 1 n.2. Respondent cites no record
evidence for this proposition because there is none. Respondent’s assertion is, in fact, belied by
the absence of any suggestion of such “importuning” in the testimony of Respondent’s witness,
Richard Wallace, who testified under a grant of prosecutorial immunity. See generally Wallace,
Tr. 1386-1388 (testifying that discussion of creating false evidence of the 1718 File’s spread
took place during a car ride with Mr. Boback).1
The Rules of Practice of the Federal Trade Commission demand better than unsupported,
ad hominem attacks on counsel. See Rule 4.1(e), 16 C.F.R. § 4.1(e) (permitting reprimand or
disbarment of an attorney who “[h]as knowingly or recklessly given false or misleading

1

Even Mr. Wallace disputes Respondent’s characterization of his testimony, as
demonstrated by Mr. Wallace’s filing in a separate proceeding. See Richard E. Wallace’s
Prelim. Objs. to Pls.’ 2d Am. Verified Compl. ¶ 28 n.6, Tiversa Holding Co. v. LabMD, Inc., No.
GD-14-016497 (Allegheny Cty., Pa. Ct. of Common Pleas Oct. 23, 2015) (“Plaintiffs also quote
a proffer given by William Sherman, counsel for LabMD in the FTC Action. . . . Mr. Sherman
does not claim to have spoken with Mr. Wallace (nor has he); rather, he is providing the Court
with his personal belief as to Mr. Wallace’s anticipated testimony. Counsel for Mr. Wallace
disputes his characterization of Wallace’s testimony . . . .”) (emphasis in original) (attached
hereto as Surreply Exhibit 1).

information, or has knowingly or recklessly participated in the giving of false information to the
Commission or any officer or employee of the Commission”)2; accord D.C. R. Prof. Conduct
3.3(a) (“A lawyer shall not knowingly [m]ake a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail
to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer
. . . .”). No evidence adduced during the Evidentiary Hearing—including through the testimony
of Respondent’s witness, Mr. Wallace, who received prosecutorial immunity for his testimony—
supports these allegations.
II.

COMMISSION SHOULD DISREGARD THE SEPTEMBER 15TH DAUGHERTY
DECLARATION
Respondent attaches to its Reply a second self-serving declaration executed by LabMD’s

CEO, Michael Daugherty (Ex. 10 to Resp’t’s Reply Br. (“September 15th Daugherty
Declaration”)) which parrots the hearsay statements of Cliff Baker, a putative “expert” who was
never disclosed as a witness, much less cross-examined, in this proceeding.3
The September 15th Daugherty Declaration purports to document Respondent’s
anticipated compliance costs associated with Part I of the Commission’s Order, information that
was not included in Mr. Daugherty’s August 30, 2016 declaration, which was submitted in
support of Respondent’s Application for Stay (“August 30th Daugherty Declaration”). Compare
Aug. 30th Daugherty Decl. ¶ 22(a), with Sept. 15th Daugherty Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10. Accordingly, the

2

Through this filing by Complaint Counsel, the Director of the Bureau of Consumer
Protection is not availing herself of the provisions of Rule 4.1(e)(2)-(4).
3

Mr. Baker’s 2014 declaration, which is unrelated to compliance costs and which is
attached as Exhibit A to Mr. Daugherty’s September 15, 2016 declaration, was excluded from
the evidentiary record in this proceeding by the July 15, 2015 Order of Chief Administrative Law
Judge D. Michael Chappell. In a separate proceeding, as noted in Paragraph 13 to Exhibit A to
Mr. Daugherty’s September 15, 2016 declaration, Mr. Baker acknowledged that he never
determined whether LabMD ever complied with the rules with which he purports to be an expert.
3

PUBLIC
substance of Respondent’s evidence regarding Part I compliance costs was not addressed in
Complaint Counsel’s Opposition to Respondent’s Application for Stay.4 The Commission’s
Rules of Practice require that Respondent’s Reply be “limited to new matters raised by the
answer.” 16 C.F.R. § 3.56(d). Similarly, the Commission may disregard arguments that are
made for the first time in reply. See Stillwagon v. City of Delaware, No. 2:14-CV-807, 2016 WL
1337292, at *7 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 31, 2016); POM Wonderful LLC, 2011 FTC LEXIS 42, at *9 n.3
(Mar. 16, 2011) (“Where the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are similar to the Commission's
Rules of Practice, those rules and case law interpreting them may be useful, though not
controlling, in adjudicating a dispute”). Furthermore, to prevail, Respondent must provide any
“affidavits or other sworn statements” in support of a stay in its application—not in reply. 16
C.F.R. § 3.56(c).

4

To the contrary, Complaint Counsel’s Opposition noted Respondent’s failure to provide
any specific facts regarding the costs associated with Part I compliance, see Compl. Counsel
Opp. at 10, an evidentiary failure Respondent cannot cure through its Reply.

PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS TO
PLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED COMPLAINT
Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(2) and Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(4), Defendant Richard Edward
Wallace asserts Preliminary Objections to the new counts and allegations in Plaintiffs’ Second
Amended Verified Complaint (“Complaint”). The Complaint adds two new claims, for Slander
Per Se (Count VII) and Commercial Disparagement/Trade Libel (Count VIII) along with new
factual allegations against Mr. Wallace. The new factual allegations impermissibly publish
information protected by court orders and should be stricken. The new claims are barred by the
statute of limitations and should be dismissed on this ground alone. The new claims should also
be dismissed because they fail to allege the elements of a viable claim against Mr. Wallace or are
barred by absolute legal privileges.
SUMMARY OF NEW CLAIMS IN THE COMPLAINT
1.

Plaintiffs’ Complaint adds allegations that Mr. Wallace contacted Mr. Daugherty

by telephone on April 2, 2014, and on April 3, 2014, and informed Mr. Daugherty, inter alia,
that Boback lied about the source of the LabMD file that later became the basis of the FTC

-21892083.2

Action (as defined in the Complaint, the “File”), that the File was never found in locations other
than a LabMD computer, and that Boback had given Wallace instructions to fabricate
information. (Compl. ¶¶ 57-58.) These allegations are lifted from an affidavit filed under seal in
two actions and barred from use or disclosure in any other actions.
2.

Plaintiffs allege two new claims against Wallace: Slander Per Se (Count VII) and

Commercial Disparagement/Trade Libel (Count VIII). Both claims rely on the statements above,
which should be stricken, and the conclusory statements that Wallace provided unspecified
“false and disparaging information regarding Tiversa” to unnamed individuals or representatives
of Defendants or the House Oversight Committee,1 see Compl. ¶ 46, and/or that, as part of the
Oversight Investigation and/or the FTC Action, “Wallace told [one or some of his coDefendants] that, during his employment at Tiversa, he, at Tiversa’s behest, engaged in various
[again, unspecified] nefarious activities,” id. at ¶ 52.2
3.

The Complaint also makes clear that any statements made by Wallace were in

furtherance of the FTC Action or the Oversight Committee Investigation or part of LabMD and
Daugherty’s protected efforts to petition the government for redress and are privileged as a
matter of law and based on the face of the Complaint. (Compl. ¶¶ 46, 53-58.) Any statements
relevant and pertinent to these actions are privileged under Pennsylvania law and the NoerrPennington Doctrine.

1

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed in Defendant Wallace’s earlier
Preliminary Objections.

2

Defendant Richard Wallace does not admit to the veracity of any of the allegations in the Complaint, but simply
acknowledges that such allegations were made. Mr. Wallace disputes the propriety of these allegations on legal
grounds, as explained in these preliminary objections, and expressly reserves his right to avail himself of any and all
rights against self-incrimination, as provided in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and under
Pennsylvania law, if called to answer the Complaint.

-31892083.2

ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITY
4.

Wallace’s preliminary objections to the Second Amended Complaint are proper

because Wallace’s objects only to the new allegations and errors appearing for the first time in
the present Complaint. Delgrosso v. Gruerio, 255 Pa. Super. 560, 564, 389 A.2d 119, 121 (Pa.
Super. Ct. 1978) (“If, as here, the amendment reveals a new error not appearing in the original
complaint, the defendant may file a new preliminary objection in order to raise the matter.”);
Wudkwych v. Borough of Canonsburg, 111 Pa. Commw. 322, 326, 533 A.2d 1104, 1106 (Pa.
Commw. Ct. 1987) (affirming granting of preliminary objections to amended complaint that
raised damages questions not included in original).
I.

Preliminary Objections Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(2): The Court Should Strike
Paragraphs 57 and 58 for Inclusion of Information in Violation of Two Court
Orders.
5.

Paragraphs 57 and 58 of the Complaint should be stricken, pursuant to Pa.R.C.P.

1028(a)(2) for “failure of a pleading to conform to law or rule of court or inclusion of scandalous
or impertinent matter.”
6.

Striking or dismissal is appropriate where a Complaint violates the law, including

procedural rules or rules imposed by another court. E.g., Cibula v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Prob. &
Parole, No. 315 M.D. 2014, 2015 WL 5448231, at *1 (Pa. Commw. Ct. Apr. 10, 2015)
(sustaining objections to unverified petition); Ferrari v. Antonacci, 456 Pa. Super. 54, 59, 689
A.2d 320, 323 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1997) (affirming dismissal under Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(2) where
plaintiff failed to timely re-file after jurisdiction-based dismissal in federal court).
7.

This is true even where the material is potentially relevant. See Triage, Inc. v.

Com., Dep't of Transp., 113 Pa. Commonwealth of Pa., 348, 353, 537 A.2d 903, 906 (Pa.

-41892083.2

Commw. Ct. 1988) (striking appendix that should have been included through amended
complaint, despite relevance to claims).
8.

The information in paragraphs 57 and 58 is drawn from an affidavit (also the

subject of Plaintiffs’ June 10, 2015, Motion for Protective Order; the “Affidavit”) that was
unintentionally disclosed by separate counsel for LabMD in another matter.3
9.

Both that Court, and the FTC Action, where the FTC later considered introducing

the Affidavit, reviewed the Affidavit only under relevant protective orders, noting concerns of
attorney-client privilege, accidental disclosure, and Congressional privilege under the Speech
and Debate Clause. (Federal Action Docket No. 61; the “Federal Order”; Order Memorializing
Bench Rulings, May 5, 2015, FTC Docket No. 9357 (granting in camera treatment to the
Affidavit; “FTC Order”)).4
10.

Both the Order in the Federal Action and the “under seal” designation in the FTC

Action bar use or disclosure of the Affidavit in any other action.
11.

The Federal Order specifically states that “Docket Entry 18-17 [the Affidavit]

shall remain sealed unless otherwise ordered by this Court;” that “[t]he Parties will not publicly
disclose or file the Affidavit;” and that parties may display the Affidavit to third parties only “in
connection with [that] litigation,” after “advance notice to, and approval by, the [House
Oversight] Committee,” and upon the third party’s written acknowledgement of the terms of the
Protective Order. (Id. at ¶¶ 3, 6-7.)
12.

So too, the FTC rules prohibit disclosure of in camera materials or the

3

LabMD, Inc. v. Tiversa Holding Corp., et al., Civil Action No. 2:15-cv-92, in the United States District Court for
the Western District of Pennsylvania (“Federal Action”).

4

Copies of the Federal Order and the FTC Order are attached as Exhibit A for the Court’s convenience. The Court
may take judicial notice of the Orders and properly consider them at this stage because they are incorporated into
the Complaint by reference and go to the compliance of the Complaint with rule of law. See Guarrasi v. Scott, 25
A.3d 394, 408 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2011); Ferrari, 456 Pa. Super. at 59, 689 A.2d at 323 (reviewing related federal
docket in considering objections under Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(2)).

-51892083.2

information contained therein to the public. 16 C.F.R. § 3.45(d).
13.

Pennsylvania law requires that, when referencing a written document, a party

either attaches the document or identify its source, so that the parties can obtain a full copy. See
Pa.R.C.P. 1019(i). Plaintiffs did not do either, and, as is clear from the Federal and FTC Orders,
Wallace cannot obtain a copy of the Affidavit at issue.
14.

This use of an unidentified portion of the Affidavit, without attaching the

Affidavit, avoids both the protections of the FTC Action and the Order and those portions of the
Affidavit that would immediately invalidate their claims.5
15.

Plaintiffs have not attempted to obtain the other tribunals’ approval, as required

by the protective orders, or attached the Affidavit, as required by Pennsylvania law. Their use of
portions of the Affidavit and information contained in the Affidavit is in violation of
Pennsylvania law, the Federal Order, and the FTC Order.

Therefore, under Pa.R.C.P.

1028(a)(2), Wallace requests that the Court strike paragraphs 57 and 58 from the Complaint.
II.

Preliminary Objections Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(4): Plaintiffs’ New Claims
are Barred by the One-Year Statute of Limitations.
16.

The Complaint’s own allegations demonstrate that both of Plaintiffs’ new claims

are barred by the one-year statute of limitations for claims for slander and related claims. 42
Pa.C.S.A. § 5523; Pro Golf Mfg., Inc. v. Tribune Review Newspaper Co., 570 Pa. 242, 247, 809
A.2d 243, 246 (2002) (applying one year SOL to slander of title/trade disparagement).
17.

The statute of limitations bars new causes of action added to an amended pleading

more than one year after the cause of action accrued, even where the new cause of action relies
on the same or similar acts already alleged. Sanchez v. City of Phila., 302 Pa. Super. 184, 188,
5

Specifically, Plaintiffs strategically omit the portion of the Affidavit counsel understands to state that Wallace’s
supposed statements were made before execution of Wallace Separation Agreement on April 6, 2014. See Banks v.
Hanoverian, Inc., No. 2807 Jan. Term 2005, 2005 WL 1522012, at *1 (Pa. Commpl. Ct.. June 23, 2005) (dismissing
breach of contract action where contract was not alleged at time of actions).

-61892083.2

448 A.2d 588, 590 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1982) (affirming refusal to add new causes of actions to
amended pleading after statute of limitations, even though existing and new claims relied on
same negligent acts).
18.

The Complaint, which was filed on September 8, 2015, alleges claims for slander

and trade libel based on statements allegedly made on April 2, 2014, and April 3, 2014. (Compl.
¶¶ 57, 58 (identifying dates); ¶¶ 134, 141 (citing these dates as the source of the claims).)
Plaintiffs are attempting to add new causes of action one year and five months after the date of
the supposed statements, without alleging any exception or tolling that would permit this.
19.

It is clear from the face of the Complaint that Plaintiffs’ new causes of action are

barred by the one-year statute of limitations, and so these new claims should be dismissed. See
Sanchez, 302 Pa. Super. at 188, 448 A.2d at 590.
III.

Preliminary Objections Pursuant Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(4): Plaintiffs Fail to Allege
Facts Sufficient to State a Claim for Slander Per Se or Trade Libel.
20.

Plaintiffs’ Complaint is legally insufficient and should be dismissed, pursuant to

Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(4), because it fails to plead facts necessary to the claims alleged. Without the
impermissible allegations in paragraphs 57 and 58, Plaintiffs fail to identify any specific
statement by Mr. Wallace that could give rise to a claim for slander or trade libel. Or, in the
alternative, any statements alleged are, based on the Complaint’s own allegations, protected by
Pennsylvania law and the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine.
A. Legal Standard
21.

When ruling on preliminary objections in the form of a demurrer, “the court must

accept as true all well-pleaded, material, and relevant facts alleged in the complaint and every
inference that is fairly deducible from those facts.” Mazur v. Trinity Area Sch. Dist., 599 Pa.
232, 241, 961 A.2d 96, 101 (2008) (affirming dismissal of complaint on preliminary objections);
-71892083.2

Chem v. Horn, 725 A.2d 226, 228 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1999) (“The question presented by a
demurrer is whether, in the facts averred, the law says with certainty that no recovery is
possible.”); see also Milliner v. Enck, 709 A.2d 417, 418 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1998).
22.

“[A] court need not accept as true conclusions of law, unwarranted inferences,

allegations, or expressions of opinion.” Bayada Nurses, Inc. v. Commonwealth of Pa., Dep't of
Labor & Indus., 607 Pa. 527, 558, 8 A.3d 866, 884 (2010).
23.

Where, as here, “plaintiff's complaint or pleading shows on its face that his claim

cannot be sustained, preliminary objections are an appropriate remedy.” Greenberg v. Aetna Ins.
Co., 427 Pa. 511, 518, 235 A.2d 576, 579 (1967) (affirming dismissal and rejecting plaintiffs’
argument that absolute immunity could not be raised on preliminary objections); see also Wurth
by Wurth v. City of Phila., 136 Pa. Commw. 629, 637, 584 A.2d 403, 407 (Pa. Commw. Ct.
1990) (dismissal is appropriate “when the complaint is clearly insufficient on its face,” because
“if the law or the rule were otherwise, it would mean long and unnecessary delays in the law.”).
B. Elements of the Claims
24.

Slander per se and trade libel are both variations of defamation claims. A claim

for slander per se requires a defamatory statement, published by the defendant, applicable to the
plaintiff, understood by the recipient to be defamatory, and imputing “(1) criminal offense, (2)
loathsome disease, (3) business misconduct, or (4) serious sexual misconduct.” Clemente v.
Espinosa, 749 F. Supp. 672, 677 (E.D. Pa. 1990); see also 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8343.
25.

Trade libel, also called injurious falsehood, commercial disparagement, or slander

of goods, is (1) publication of a false and disparaging statement; (2) intending (or with reason to
expect) pecuniary loss; (3) from which pecuniary loss does in fact result; and (4) knowing of the
falsity or acting with reckless disregard for the falsity of the statement.” Maverick Steel Co. v.

-81892083.2

Dick Corp./Barton Malow, 2012 Pa. Super. 173, 173, 54 A.3d 352, 354 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2012);
see also Triester v. 191 Tenants Ass'n, 272 Pa. Super. 271, 277, 415 A.2d 698, 701 (Pa. Super.
Ct. 1979).
C. The Complaint Fails to Identify a Statement That Could Create a Claim for
Slander Per Se or Trade Libel.
26.

Plaintiffs fail to allege any statement which could be the basis of a claim for

slander or trade libel. See Clemente, 749 F. Supp. at 677; Maverick Steel Co., 2012 Pa. Super. at
173, 54 A.3d at 354.
27.

Either claim must identify the specific words with which Plaintiffs take issue, as

well as the specific listener, so that the Court can determine if the statements could be
defamatory, as a matter of law. See Carescience, Inc. v. Panto, No. 04583 Sept. Term 2003,
2003 WL 22266101, at *1 (Pa. Commpl. Ct. Sept. 23, 2003); see also Walker v. Grand Cent.
Sanitation, Inc., 430 Pa. Super. 236, 243, 634 A.2d 237, 240 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1993).
28.

Other than the impermissible statements, which, as discussed above, should be

stricken from the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege only that Mr. Wallace made unspecified
“disparaging statements about Tiversa and Mr. Boback,” and/or told unspecified parties that
Tiversa encouraged him to “engage[] in various nefarious activities.” (Compl. ¶¶ 52, 118).6
29.

Plaintiffs ask the Court to determine that these unspecified statements could, as a

matter of law, be defamatory, based only on their opinion and legal conclusion.

This is

insufficient to state a claim, See Bayada Nurses, Inc., 607 Pa. at 558, 8 A.3d at 884 (opinions

6

Plaintiffs also quote a proffer given by William Sherman, counsel for LabMD in the FTC Action. (Compl. ¶ 53).
This quote is simply not a statement by Mr. Wallace. Mr. Sherman does not claim to have spoken with Mr. Wallace
(nor has he); rather, he is providing the Court with his personal belief as to Mr. Wallace’s anticipated testimony.
Counsel for Mr. Wallace disputes his characterization of Wallace’s testimony because it is just that – a

and legal conclusions need not be taken as fact for purposes of a motion to dismiss). Without an
identifiable statement by Wallace that is demonstrably defamatory, these claims cannot stand.
D. Plaintiffs Fail to Allege Any Damages Resulting from the Alleged Slander or Trade
Libel.
30.

Trade libel requires specific allegations of pecuniary loss, resulting from the

statements at issue. Maverick Steel Co., 2012 Pa. Super. at 173, 54 A.3d at 354.
31.

Slander requires allegations of general damages, unless the plaintiff alleges both

status as a private figure plaintiff and actual malice, that is, “with knowledge that the statement
was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.” Joseph v. Scranton Times,
L.P., 2014 Pa. Super. 49, 49, 89 A.3d 251, 261 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2014), appeal granted, 105 A.3d
655 (2014); Walker, 430 Pa. Super. at 250, 634 A.2d at 244 (slander per se claim could not
succeed without evidence that the hearer of the statement thought less of the plaintiff or that the
statements had any adverse affect on plaintiff).
32.

Plaintiffs do not allege any facts demonstrating general damages or any facts

demonstrating specific pecuniary loss.

Plaintiffs do not identify any potential or existing

contract lost or impaired or even any potential or existing client who heard the alleged
statements, directly or indirectly, from which damages could be inferred. See Walker, 430 Pa.
Super. at 250, 634 A.2d at 244. The conclusory statements that they suffered general or specific
pecuniary loss, without facts in support, are insufficient to state a claim. See id. (requiring
general damages for slander claim); Maverick Steel Co., 2012 Pa. Super. at 173, 54 A.3d at 354
(requiring specific allegations of pecuniary loss for trade libel claim).
33.

Plaintiffs also do not allege any facts demonstrating that Wallace acted with

actual malice, such that they could claim presumed damages and avoid the pleading requirements
for the slander claim. (Presumed damages are not available in trade libel claims.) Plaintiffs
-101892083.2

allege only similar conclusory statements that need not be taken as true for purposes of a
demurrer. See Compl. ¶ 138; Bayada Nurses, Inc., 607 Pa. at 558, 8 A.3d at 884 (opinions and
legal conclusions need not be taken as fact for purposes of a motion to dismiss).
34.

Even if Plaintiffs had alleged facts demonstrating actual malice, Plaintiffs are, at a

minimum, limited-purpose private figures, who are not entitled to presumed damages. See
Joseph v. Scranton Times, L.P., 2014 Pa. Super. at 49, 89 A.3d at 269; Weber v. Lancaster
Newspapers, Inc., 2005 Pa. Super. 192, 878 A.2d 63, 75 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2005), quoting Gertz v.
Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 345 (1974) (a public figure is one who “uses purposeful
activity to thrust his personality into a public controversy” or “invites and merits attention and
comment”).
35.

The Complaint alleges on its face that Plaintiffs interact with the FTC with

sufficient frequency to create a separate entity, ¶¶ 23-24; are the subject of the Book and several
related news and television appearances, ¶¶ 28-34; is involved in Congressional hearings, ¶¶ 6467; and testified before Congress regarding Marine One, ¶¶ 57, 65 (incorporating by reference
Congressional hearing). At a minimum, Plaintiffs are limited-purpose public figures on the
matters at issue in this case, and presumed damages are unavailable as a result.
36.

As Plaintiffs have not alleged the specific pecuniary loss required for a claim of

trade libel, that claim should be dismissed. As Plaintiffs also have not alleged any facts showing
general damages or, alternatively, actual malice with private figure status to support presumed
damages, this claim should also be dismissed.
E. Plaintiffs Have Not Stated a Claim for Punitive Damages.
37.

Plaintiffs have not alleged facts supporting their claim for punitive damages. To

state a viable claim for punitive damages, any tort complaint must allege facts demonstrating

-111892083.2

“conduct that is outrageous because of the defendant's evil motives or his reckless indifference to
the rights of others.” Arbor Associates, Inc. v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare, No. 03976 Aug. Term
2002, 2003 WL 1847497, at *2 (Pa. Commpl. Ct. Feb. 28, 2003) (dismissing punitive damages
claims and striking references to same); see also Carescience, Inc., 2003 WL 22266101, at *2.
38.

In the slander or trade libel context, both of which implicate the First

Amendment, a claim for punitive damages must also allege that the defendant spoke with “actual
malice.” Joseph v. Scranton Times, L.P., 2014 Pa. Super. at 49, 89 A.3d at 272. As discussed
above, Plaintiffs have not alleged facts suggesting that Wallace acted with actual malice, and the
claim for punitive damages should be barred on that ground alone.
39.

Plaintiffs’ conclusory statements that Wallace “acted maliciously” or in a way

that “demonstrates intentionally willful, wanton, and reckless behavior,” Compl. §§ 61, 139,
without facts supporting this conclusion, are insufficient. See Carescience, Inc., 2003 WL
22266101, at *2 (dismissing punitive damages claim unsupported by factual allegations showing
wanton, willful misconduct). Plaintiffs have not stated a claim for punitive damages under either
new claim, and therefore the request should be dismissed and any references stricken.
IV.

Preliminary Objection Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(4): Plaintiffs’ Complaint is
Barred as a Matter of Law by the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine and Pennsylvania
Law.
40.

Plaintiffs’ new claims are legally insufficient and should be dismissed, pursuant to

Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(4), because the face of the Complaint makes clear that Wallace’s actions are
protected by the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine and Pennsylvania law. See Greenberg, 427 Pa. at
517, 235 A.2d at 579; Wurth by Wurth, 136 Pa. Commw. at 637, 584 A.2d at 407.7

7

The list of decisions applying Noerr-Pennington and judicial privilege protections at the preliminary objection or
motion to dismiss stage is extensive. E.g., Smolsky v. Pennsylvania Gen. Assembly, 34 A.3d 316, 322 (Pa. Commw.
Ct. 2011), aff'd sub nom., Smolsky v. Pennsylvania Gen. Assembly & Legislatures of the Com. of Pa., 616 Pa. 475,
50 A.3d 1255 (2012) (sustaining preliminary objections where legislative immunity was clear from the face of the

-121892083.2

A.

Wallace’s Statements, to the Extent Alleged, Were Part of Co-Defendants’ Efforts
to Petition the Government and are Protected by the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine.
41.

The act of petitioning the government is fully protected by the First Amendment

of the U.S. Constitution, as recognized by Pennsylvania courts and the U.S. Supreme Court.
E.R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 137 (1961);
N.A.A.C.P. v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 915 (1982) (providing Noerr-Pennington
protections to statements to motivate public action as part of such efforts); Sudarkasa v. Glanton,
57 Pa. D. & C.4th 472, 508 (Pa. Commpl. Ct. 2002), aff'd sub nom., Sudarkas v. Glanton, 855
A.2d 146 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2004); see also 5 U.S.C.A. § 7211; see also Brownsville Golden Age
Nursing Home, Inc. v. Wells, 839 F.2d 155, 160 (3d Cir. 1988).
42.

The only statements allegedly made by Wallace were to Mr. Daugherty, in April

2014, when Daugherty was involved in litigation with the FTC, see Compl. ¶ 41, discussed
below, and taking actions to lobby government and public opinion for assistance in that action,
see id. at ¶¶ 34, 46. This is unquestionably the type of petitioning activity protected by the
Noerr-Pennington Doctrine. See Sudarkasa, 57 Pa. D. & C. 4th at 500; see also N.A.A.C.P., 458
U.S. at 915.
43.

Communications among the Defendants were part and parcel of a direct appeal to

Congress, through the Oversight Committee, and Mr. Daugherty’s efforts to motivate public
opinion. These statements are clearly protected by the Doctrine and claims based on these
statements should be dismissed.

Complaint); Gale v. City of Phila., 86 A.3d 318, 319 (Pa. Commw. Ct.), appeal denied, 99 A.3d 927 (2014)
(affirming dismissal based on governmental immunity “where the defense of immunity is clearly applicable on the
face of the complaint”); Firetree Ltd. v. Fairchild, 920 A.2d 913, 919 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2007) (affirming dismissal
on Noerr Pennington and Speech and Debate clause grounds); see also Trustees of Univ. of Pa. v. St. Jude
Children's Research Hosp., 940 F. Supp. 2d 233, 242 (E.D. Pa. 2013) (dismissing claims barred by NoerrPennington Doctrine because, “taking all allegations as true, … the plaintiff is not entitled to relief as a matter of
law”).

-131892083.2

B.

Defendants’ Statements and Participation in the FTC Action are Protected by
Pennsylvania Law.
44.

Similarly, Pennsylvania law protects all communications “relevant” or “pertinent”

“to any stage of a judicial proceeding,” including statements made by witnesses both in trial
testimony and in preparation for testimony. Smith v. Griffiths, 327 Pa. Super. 418, 423, 476 A.2d
22, 24 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984); Triester v. 191 Tenants Ass'n, 272 Pa. Super. 271, 279, 415 A.2d
698, 702 (1979) (affirming dismissal of defamation of title/commercial disparagement claim
where defamatory statements alleged were all in context of judicial proceedings); Pelagatti v.
Cohen, 370 Pa. Super. 422, 432, 536 A.2d 1337, 1342 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1987).
45.

The Complaint alleges Wallace made objectionable statements in April 2014,

long after the FTC Action was underway. (Compl. ¶¶ 46, 57, 58.) As also alleged in the
Complaint, Mr. Wallace’s formal testimony was requested and compelled in the FTC Action.
(Compl. ¶¶ 53, 54.) These statements, alleged only to have been made by Wallace to a party
involved in ongoing litigation, about facts essential to that litigation, are “relevant and pertinent
to” formal judicial proceedings.
46.

The only statements allegedly made by Mr. Wallace are therefore protected by

judicial privilege, and the two new claims, based on those statements, should be dismissed.
CONCLUSION
47.

For the reasons discussed above, Defendant Richard Edward Wallace respectfully

requests the Court to sustain his preliminary objections, strike paragraphs 57 and 58, and dismiss
Counts VII and VIII in the Complaint, with prejudice.

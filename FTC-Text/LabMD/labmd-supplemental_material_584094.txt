Complaint Counsel took no position on the motion for leave to withdraw.
On September 14, 2016, the Commission entered an Order requiring "Counsel of Record
to file a short letter to explain further why good cause exists for their withdrawal from this matter
for the Commission to consider in camera." Ex. 1.
Accordingly, Respondent Counsel submits ex parte in camera confidential the letter dated
September 20, 2016 (with attachment), pursuant to Commission Rules 3.45 and 4.7. 16 C.F.R. §§
3 .45 and 4. 7 (2016); see Ex. 2.
These documents are submitted ex parte and confidential because they are
"communication[s] occasioned by and concerning a nonadjudicative function ofthe Commission,"
and are not "relevant to the merits of [this] or a factually related proceeding." See Commission
Rule 4.7(b)l) & 4.7(±), 16 C.F.R. §§ 4.7(b)(l) &4.7(f).
Further, these documents are submitted in camera and confidential pursuant to the
Commission's September 14, 2016 Order, and the District of Columbia Rules of Professional
Conduct. See D.C. Rule ofProf. Conduct l. l 6(b)(4), l. l 6(b)(5); see also D.C. Ethics Opinion 317
(listing examples of situations when an attorney's withdrawal is permitted).
The attorney-client privilege and/or work product doctrine may be implicated by this filing,
and Respondent Counsel asserts that ex parte in camera treatment is necessary to protect the
confidentiality and privilege properly accorded these communications.
Respondent's Counsel are not at liberty to elaborate beyond what is set forth in Exhibit 2
regarding the reasons why good cause exists to grant this Motion. See D.C. R. Prof. Cond. 1.6.

Cf In re Gonzalez, 773 A.2d 1026, 1030-32 (D.C. 2001) (addressing improper motion for leave to
withdrawal).

While LabMD continues to withhold consent to the withdrawal at issue,3 LabMD has no
extant representation agreement with Respondent Counsel and CoA Inst. Moreover, LabMD has
engaged the law firm of Ropes and Gray LLP to represent it before a United States circuit court of
appeals pursuant to 45 U.S.C. § 45(c).4 Moreover, FTC rules permit LabMD to proceed prose, if
necessary before the Commission. Commission Rule 4.l(a)(2), 16 C.F.R. § 4.l(a)(2).
For the foregoing reasons, Respondent Counsel respectfully request that the Commission
GRANT the Motion for Leave to Withdraw as Counsel of Record for Respondent LabMD, Inc.;
find that no material adverse effects will result from withdrawal or that other good cause exists to
permit withdrawal; and ORDER that the Secretary is directed to withdraw the appearances of
Respondent's Counsel as Counsel of Record for LabMD, Inc. from the Docket and Record in this
case.

Based upon public emails sent September 20, 2016 to Secretary Clark, and cc'ed to Complaint
Counsel, Respondent Counsel understands that LabMD, through its President and ChiefExecutive
Officer Michael J. Daugherty, is filing an ex parte in camera confidential opposition to Respondent
Counsel's Motion to Withdraw.

ORDER REQUESTING SUPPLEMENTAL FILING

Attorneys of record for Respondent LabMD, Inc., Patrick J. Massari, and Erica L.
Marshall of the Cause of Action Institute (“Counsel of Record”), have filed a motion for leave to
withdraw as counsel of record from this matter. They argue that ceasing their representation of
LabMD would have no material adverse effect on LabMD’s interests, but state that LabMD does
not consent to their withdrawal. Counsel of Record also assert that there is good cause for their
withdrawal. However, they provide no additional information supporting this assertion in their
motion. Instead, they offer to provide such support in camera. Complaint Counsel take no
position on the motion.
It is important for the Commission to have a complete understanding of the relevant facts
as it considers this motion. We therefore direct Counsel of Record to file a short letter to explain
further why good cause exists for their withdrawal from this matter for the Commission to
consider in camera. Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Patrick J. Massari and Erica L. Marshall file a short
letter containing any supplemental information they wish to submit in support of their motion for
leave to withdraw as counsel of record, on or before September 20, 2016. Counsel may request
in camera treatment of their submission in accordance with Commission Rule 3.45. 16 C.F.R.
§ 3.45 (2016).
By the Commission.

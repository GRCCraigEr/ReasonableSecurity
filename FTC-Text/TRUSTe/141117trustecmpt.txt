In the Matter of

DOCKET NO. C-

COMPLAINT
The Federal Trade Commission (“Commission”), having reason to believe that True
Ultimate Standards Everywhere, Inc., a corporation, has violated the provisions of the Federal
Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), and it appearing to the Commission that this proceeding is
in the public interest, alleges:
1. Respondent True Ultimate Standards Everywhere, Inc., also doing business as TRUSTe,
Inc. (“TRUSTe”), is a privately-owned, Delaware corporation with its principal office or
place of business at 835 Market Street, Suite 800, San Francisco, California 94103.
2. TRUSTe was formed as a California non-profit corporation on June 10, 1997. On June
20, 2008, TRUSTe formed a for-profit Delaware corporation and transferred all of the
assets of the California non-profit entity to the for-profit corporation pursuant to an Asset
Purchase Agreement effective July 3, 2008.
3. Respondent has advertised, offered for sale, and sold data privacy services to companies,
including a variety of assessments and certifications, monitoring tools, and compliance
controls.
4. The acts and practices of Respondent as alleged in this complaint are in or affecting
commerce, as “commerce” is defined in Section 4 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 44.

TRUSTe’s Certified Privacy Seals
5. Since approximately June 1997, Respondent has offered clients Certified Privacy Seals
(“Privacy Seals”) for display on clients’ websites. TRUSTe has more recently offered
these seals for mobile applications. Respondent provides these seals to clients that meet
designated requirements for the programs that Respondent administers (“Program
Requirements”). These requirements include specifications related to transparency of
company practices, verification of privacy practices, and consumer choice regarding the
collection and use of consumer personal information.
6. Respondent advertises itself as “the #1 privacy brand” and asserts that its “Certified
Privacy Seal is recognized globally by consumers, businesses, and regulators as
demonstrating privacy best practices.”
7. Respondent’s Privacy Seal programs include, but are not limited to, TRUSTed Websites
(since 1997), which certifies websites; COPPA/Children’s Privacy (2001), which certifies
compliance with the FTC’s Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Rule; EU Safe
Harbor (2002), which assists with certification to the EU-US Safe Harbor framework for
transatlantic data transfers; TRUSTed Downloads (2006), which certifies software;
TRUSTed Cloud (2011), which certifies data processing services through cloud
platforms; TRUSTed Apps (2011), which certifies mobile applications; and TRUSTed
Data (2011), which certifies data collection practices of non-consumer facing entities.
8. Companies that meet the Program Requirements of a particular Privacy Seal must display
to consumers a corresponding seal on their websites and mobile applications to
demonstrate publicly to consumers their compliance with the relevant TRUSTe program.
9. In connection with its Privacy Seal programs, Respondent has provided clients with
images of seals to display on their websites and mobile applications, including, but not
limited to “Click-to-verify” seals containing a graphic icon, and text indicating to
consumers an ability to click on the seal:

These “Click-to-verify” seals are required and must be displayed by a client on its
privacy policy webpage. They are linked to a webpage hosted on the www.truste.com
website, which provides verification of the sealholder’s name, the specific privacy seal(s)
held, and the validity date for each seal. The website also links to the Program
Requirements for the Privacy Seals.

10. Respondent tests and verifies client compliance with its Program Requirements
underlying its Privacy Seals through scanning technology, client interviews, document
collection, and manual testing and review of client websites and mobile applications.
11. TRUSTe purports to recertify privacy sealholders on an annual basis to identify, for
example: (1) material changes to privacy policies (e.g., new or expanded collection/uses
of personal information such as use of cookies for behavioral advertising); (2) seal
validation (e.g., improper placement, old versions, and bad links); (3) changes in
company ownership or business model (e.g., adoption of advertising supported content);
and (4) where relevant, compliance with external third-party program requirements (e.g.,
Federal Trade Commission Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act safe harbor, or U.S.
Department of Commerce self-certification to the US/EU Safe Harbor).
12. At all times relevant to this complaint, Respondent has controlled the design of its seals,
as well as the design, content, and format of the www.truste.com webpage to which these
seals link.
Violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act
Misrepresentation of certification status of TRUSTe clients
13. Since approximately 2011, Respondent has disseminated or has caused to be
disseminated to consumers, on the www.truste.com website, Program Requirements
containing the following statement:
III.

Minimum Program Requirements
…
B. Participant Accountability
…
3.

Annual Recertification
a. Participant shall undergo recertification to verify ongoing compliance
with these Program Requirements annually.
(Exhibit A, Program Requirements, February 2011, available at
www.truste.com)

Prior to 2011, Respondent disseminated or had caused to be disseminated to consumers
Program Requirements containing the following statement:

3

II.

Participant Responsibilities
...
C.

Recertification.

Participant must seek recertification by TRUSTe annually

...
14. The statements set forth in Paragraph 13 have been included in Respondent’s Program
Requirements for at least each of the following programs: TRUSTed Websites (since
1997), COPPA/Children’s Privacy (2001), EU Safe Harbor (2002), TRUSTed Cloud
(2011), TRUSTed Apps (2011), TRUSTed Data (2011), and TRUSTed Smart Grid
(2012).
Count 1
15. Through the means described in Paragraph 13, Respondent has represented, expressly or
by implication, that TRUSTe has recertified annually all companies displaying a
TRUSTe Certified Privacy Seal to ensure ongoing compliance with the Program
Requirements.
16. In fact, from 2006 until January 2013, Respondent did not conduct annual recertifications
for all companies holding TRUSTe Certified Privacy Seals. In over 1,000 instances,
TRUSTe conducted no annual review of the company’s compliance with applicable
Program Requirements. Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 13 was
false or misleading.
Misrepresentations regarding non-profit status of TRUSTe
17. Prior to its transition to a for-profit entity on July 3, 2008, Respondent required its clients
to display in their privacy policies the following language TRUSTe developed:
“TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build
users’ trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair
information practices.”
18. In early July 2008, Respondent notified all active and current clients that its tax status
would change from non-profit to for-profit status. On July 15, 2008, the company
issued a public press release announcing the company’s transition to a for-profit entity.
19. In numerous instances since July 3, 2008, the date when TRUSTe formed a for-profit
Delaware corporation and ceased to be a non-profit California corporation, Respondent
has recertified clients who have failed to update references to the company’s for-profit
status. Some TRUSTe clients’ privacy policies continued to describe TRUSTe as a
non-profit entity until fall of 2013.

Count 2
20. Through the means described in Paragraphs 17 and 19, Respondent has represented,
expressly or by implication, that TRUSTe is a non-profit organization.
21. In fact, Respondent has not been a non-profit organization since July 3, 2008.
Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 20 was false or misleading.
22. By providing clients with the language in Paragraph 17 and continuing to certify clients
using that language as described in Paragraph 19, Respondent has furnished the means
and instrumentalities for the commission of the deceptive acts or practices alleged in
Paragraph 21.
23. The acts and practices of Respondent as alleged in this complaint constitute deceptive
acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal
Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a).
THEREFORE, the Federal Trade Commission this ___ day of __________, ____, has
issued this complaint against Respondent.
By the Commission.

In the Matter of

AGREEMENT CONTAINING
CONSENT ORDER
DOCKET NO.

The Federal Trade Commission (“Commission”) has conducted an investigation of
certain acts and practices of True Ultimate Standards Everywhere, Inc., a corporation d/b/a
TRUSTe, Inc. (“TRUSTe” or “proposed Respondent”). Proposed Respondent, having been
represented by counsel, is willing to enter into an agreement containing a consent order resolving
the allegations contained in the attached draft complaint. Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY AGREED by and between True Ultimate Standards Everywhere, Inc.,
and counsel for the Federal Trade Commission that:
1. Proposed Respondent True Ultimate Standards Everywhere, Inc., also doing business as
TRUSTe, Inc., is a privately-owned, Delaware corporation with its principal office or
place of business at 835 Market Street, Suite 800, San Francisco, California 94103.
2. Proposed Respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft complaint.
3. Proposed Respondent waives:
A. Any further procedural steps;
B. The requirement that the Commission’s decision contain a statement of findings
of fact and conclusions of law; and
C. All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity
of the order entered pursuant to this agreement.
4. This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and
until it is accepted by the Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission,
it, together with the draft complaint, will be placed on the public record for a period of
thirty (30) days and information about it publicly released. The Commission thereafter
may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify proposed Respondent,
in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve
1

its complaint (in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision in disposition
of the proceeding.
5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by
proposed Respondent that the law has been violated as alleged in the draft complaint, or
that the facts as alleged in the draft complaint, other than the jurisdictional facts, are true.
6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such
acceptance is not subsequently withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2.34 of the Commission’s Rules, the Commission may, without further notice
to proposed Respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance
with the attached draft complaint and its decision containing the following order in
disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information about it public. When so
entered, the order shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or
set aside in the same manner and within the same time provided by statute for other
orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery of the complaint and the
decision and order to proposed Respondent’s addresses as stated in this agreement by any
means specified in Section 4.4(a) of the Commission’s Rules shall constitute service.
Proposed Respondent waives any right it may have to any other manner of service. The
complaint may be used in construing the terms of the order. No agreement,
understanding, representation, or interpretation not contained in the order or the
agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the order.
7. Proposed Respondent has read the draft complaint and consent order. Proposed
Respondent understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided by
law and other appropriate relief for each violation of the order after it becomes final.

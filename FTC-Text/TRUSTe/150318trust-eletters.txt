In the Matter of TRUSTe, Inc., File No. 1323219

Thank you for your comment on behalf of the Center for Digital Democracy, American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood,
Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Watchdog, and The Rudd
Center for Food Policy and Obesity (“CDD, et al.”) regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s
(“Commission” or “FTC”) consent agreement in the above-entitled proceeding. The
Commission has placed your comment on the public record pursuant to rule 4.9(b)(6)(ii) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, 16 C.F.R. § 4.9(b)(6)(ii), and has given it serious consideration.
The Commission’s complaint against Respondent TRUSTe, Inc. (“TRUSTe”) includes
two counts alleging violations of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”).
Count One alleges that TRUSTe misrepresented to consumers the frequency with which it
reviews and verifies the practices of companies displaying its web-based and mobile seals.
Count Two alleges that TRUSTe provided to its sealholders the means and instrumentalities to
misrepresent that TRUSTe is a non-profit corporation.
The proposed order contains provisions designed to prevent TRUSTe from committing
future violations similar to those alleged in the complaint. Part I of the proposed order prohibits
TRUSTe from misrepresenting (1) the steps TRUSTe takes to evaluate, certify, review, or
recertify a company’s privacy practices; (2) the frequency with which TRUSTe evaluates,
certifies, reviews, or recertifies a company’s privacy practices; (3) the corporate status of
TRUSTe and its independence; and (4) the extent to which any person or entity is a member of,
adheres to, complies with, is certified by, is endorsed by, or otherwise participates in any privacy
program sponsored by TRUSTe. Part II of the proposed order also prohibits TRUSTe from
providing to any person or entity the means and instrumentalities (including any required or
model language for use in any privacy policy or statement) to misrepresent any of the same items
in Part I. Parts III and IV of the proposed order contain additional reporting and recordkeeping
requirements, beyond those required under the rule implementing the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act (“COPPA”), with respect to TRUSTe’s COPPA/Children’s Privacy seal. The
proposed order, which terminates after 20 years, includes standard recordkeeping and service
provisions, as well as requirements for TRUSTe to file compliance reports with the Commission.

Your comment expresses CDD et al.’s general support of the complaint and the proposed
consent order’s directives, but urges the Commission to (1) revise the amount of disgorgement;
and (2) extend the duration of additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and make all
reporting filed by TRUSTe public. Your comment additionally requests that the Commission
make public all COPPA safe harbor annual reports.
First, your comment states that the proposed $200,000 disgorgement is “too little to
deprive TRUSTe of its unjust enrichment” and is unlikely to deter other safe harbors from
similar behavior. Your comment also describes the disgorgement amount as much lower than
civil penalties against other companies alleged to have violated COPPA. At the outset, we note
that most of TRUSTe’s failures to recertify involved seal programs unrelated to COPPA. In
deciding whether the amount and type of monetary remedy in this or any other consent order is
appropriate in relation to the alleged violations, the Commission carefully considers a variety of
factors, including the type of monetary relief authorized by law, the specific facts at issue, and
the alleged violations of the law. The complaint alleges that the company violated Section 5 of
the FTC Act, which, unlike COPPA, does not authorize the Commission to seek civil penalties
for an initial violation. Section 5 does allow the Commission to seek equitable relief;
accordingly, one of the remedies in the proposed order is disgorgement of $200,000 in ill-gotten
gains. The $200,000 figure reflects a significant portion of the monies that TRUSTe received
from its business clients for the annual reviews that it failed to conduct, despite representations to
consumers that it recertified sealholders annually. Further, should TRUSTe violate any term of
the final order, it could be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $16,000 per violation per
day (pursuant to Section 5(l) of the FTC Act).
Second, you recommend that the Commission require public disclosure of all TRUSTe
order compliance reporting, as well as all COPPA safe harbor reports mandated by 16 C.F.R. §
312.11(d). The Commission agrees that there is a public benefit to providing transparency
regarding a company’s compliance with the provisions of an order, or a rule such as the COPPA
Rule. As the Commission has noted in the past, the public may seek access to such information
by making a request under the Freedom of Information Act. We refer you to these previous
statements, recognizing, as you note, that there is ongoing litigation involving the disclosure of
reports that COPPA safe harbors are required to provide the Commission under 16 C.F.R.
§312.11(d). The Commission has produced these reports with appropriate redactions to protect
confidential commercial information. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4); 15 U.S.C. § 46(f).
Relatedly, as to the duration of the reporting and recordkeeping requirements under Parts
III and IV, we believe that the 10-year time period is appropriate. The additional requirements
under Parts III and IV supplement the annual reporting requirements for approved safe harbor
programs in the COPPA rule itself, which would continue to apply to TRUSTe for as long as
TRUSTe remains an approved safe harbor program under COPPA, or until the order expires,
whichever comes first. Provisions in Commission orders that require respondents to create or
file additional reports vary in duration, and some recent Commission orders require reporting and
recordkeeping for less than the 10 years required by the proposed order. It is important to note
that Section IX of the proposed order requires TRUSTe, throughout the term of the order, to
respond within 10 days to any Commission request for a report on compliance with the order.

In light of these considerations, the Commission has determined that the public interest
would best be served by issuing the Decision and Order in the above-titled proceeding in final
form without any modifications. The final Decision and Order and other relevant materials are
available from the Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov. It helps the Commission’s
analysis to hear from a variety of sources in its work, and it thanks you again for your comment.
By direction of the Commission.

In the Matter of TRUSTe, Inc., File No. 1323219

Thank you for your comment regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s (“Commission”
or “FTC”) consent agreement in the above-entitled proceeding. The Commission has placed
your comment on the public record pursuant to rule 4.9(b)(6)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice, 16 C.F.R. § 4.9(b)(6)(ii), and has given it serious consideration.
The Commission’s complaint against Respondent TRUSTe, Inc. (“TRUSTe”) includes
two counts alleging violations of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”).
Count One alleges that TRUSTe misrepresented to consumers the frequency with which it
reviews and verifies the practices of companies displaying its web-based and mobile seals.
Count Two alleges that TRUSTe provided to its sealholders the means and instrumentalities to
misrepresent that TRUSTe is a non-profit corporation.
The proposed order contains provisions designed to prevent TRUSTe from committing
future violations similar to those alleged in the complaint. Part I of the proposed order prohibits
TRUSTe from misrepresenting (1) the steps TRUSTe takes to evaluate, certify, review, or
recertify a company’s privacy practices; (2) the frequency with which TRUSTe evaluates,
certifies, reviews, or recertifies a company’s privacy practices; (3) the corporate status of
TRUSTe and its independence; and (4) the extent to which any person or entity is a member of,
adheres to, complies with, is certified by, is endorsed by, or otherwise participates in any privacy
program sponsored by TRUSTe. Part II of the proposed order also prohibits TRUSTe from
providing to any person or entity the means and instrumentalities (including any required or
model language for use in any privacy policy or statement) to misrepresent any of the same items
in Part I. Parts III and IV of the proposed order contain additional reporting and recordkeeping
requirements, beyond those required under the rule implementing the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act (“COPPA”), with respect to TRUSTe’s COPPA/Children’s Privacy seal. The
proposed order, which terminates after 20 years, includes standard recordkeeping and service
provisions, as well as requirements for TRUSTe to file compliance reports with the Commission.
Your comment urges the Commission to revoke TRUSTe’s COPPA safe harbor status,
partly because of your concern that TRUSTe did not comply with COPPA’s safe harbor
provisions. Under the revised COPPA Rule, which went into effect on July 1, 2013, safe harbor
programs must conduct an annual certification. We note that prior to that date, the COPPA Rule

required safe harbor programs to have a mechanism for assessing compliance, but it did not
contain an annual certification requirement for safe harbor programs.
The Commission regards the ability to revoke an organization’s safe harbor status as an
important mechanism to ensure the integrity of the program. However, the Commission does not
consider this action warranted in every instance, nor the only means of addressing shortcomings
in a safe harbor program’s processes. In this case, we note that TRUSTe’s failure to conduct the
promised annual certifications affected only a subset of TRUSTe’s business clients, and most of
TRUSTe’s failures to recertify involved seal programs unrelated to COPPA.
Nonetheless, the Commission agrees that the COPPA safe harbor program requires strong
FTC oversight. Accordingly, the proposed order contains provisions designed to prevent
TRUSTe from committing future violations similar to those alleged in the complaint. The
proposed order also imposes additional reporting and recordkeeping requirements on TRUSTe,
beyond those required under the COPPA Rule. It is important to note that Section IX of the
proposed order requires TRUSTe, throughout the term of the order, to respond within 10 days to
any Commission request for a report on compliance with the order. Once the order becomes
final, TRUSTe will risk civil penalties of up to $16,000 per violation per day (as provided by
Section 5(l) of the FTC Act, 45 U.S.C. § 45(l), as adjusted by 16 C.F.R. § 1.98(c)).
In light of these considerations, the Commission has determined that the public interest
would best be served by issuing the Decision and Order in the above-titled proceeding in final
form without any modifications. The final Decision and Order and other relevant materials are
available from the Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov. It helps the Commission’s
analysis to hear from a variety of sources in its work, and it thanks you again for your comment.

QUESTIONS PRESENTED
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act makes unlawful all “unfair
or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1). In
the complaint at issue here, the Federal Trade Commission has alleged that
Wyndham violated that provision by failing to take reasonable measures to protect
credit card numbers that its customers entrusted to it and that it stored on its
computer networks. The computer system was hacked, and the numbers were
stolen and used to make fraudulent purchases. The questions presented are:
1)

Whether a company’s unreasonable failure to protect the security of

consumer data entrusted to it can constitute an “unfair … act or practice”;
2)

Whether Wyndham had constitutionally sufficient notice that it

needed to take reasonable steps to protect the consumer data entrusted to it; and
3)

Whether the complaint sufficiently alleged that the data breaches

caused consumers substantial injury that they could not have reasonably avoided.
RELATED CASES AND PROCEEDINGS
This case was before the Court previously on Wyndham’s petition for leave
to appeal (No. 14-8091). There are no other directly related cases or proceedings.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
The Court reviews de novo a district court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss.
The FTC’s interpretation of the FTC Act, however, is entitled to deference under

Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842
(1984).
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Virtually all modern commerce involves the collection and storage of
consumers’ personal data, such as credit card numbers, passwords, and social
security numbers. That personal information is an appealing target for hackers,
who can use it to steal identities, make fraudulent purchases, and cause other harm
to consumers. Yet a consumer who gives personal information to a merchant is
powerless to protect that information once it is in the merchant’s hands.
Consumers must depend on the merchant to take reasonable measures to keep their
personal data secure. Implementing such measures is thus fundamental to modern
consumer protection.
Here, Wyndham ignored multiple warning signs that its network had been
compromised, and it failed to address repeated and obvious security lapses that left
its computer networks vulnerable to intruders. As a result, hackers infiltrated
Wyndham’s computer network and stole customer credit card information, which
was used to make millions of dollars in fraudulent charges on the accounts of
Wyndham’s customers. The FTC sued Wyndham for failing to take reasonable
steps to protect its customers’ data. That failure, the FTC’s complaint charged in

relevant part, violated the prohibition on “unfair … acts or practices” in Section 5
of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45.
Wyndham moved under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss the complaint on
various grounds. The district court denied that motion in a detailed opinion, and
Wyndham has now taken this interlocutory appeal. Because this appeal arises
from the denial of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, this Court is “required to accept as true
all allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn
therefrom, and view them in the light most favorable to” the FTC. Evancho v.
Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, 350 (3d Cir. 2005). The discussion below likewise assumes
that the complaint’s allegations have been proven.
1.

The Statutory Scheme

Section 5(a) of the FTC Act broadly prohibits all “unfair or deceptive acts or
practices in or affecting commerce” and “empower[s] and direct[s]” the FTC to
prevent such acts, except in certain defined market contexts. 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1),
(2). This appeal involves a claim under the “unfair practices” provision of Section
5.1 Because the modern economy gives rise to a limitless variety of unfair
practices, courts have long read the broad language of this provision as leaving it to
the FTC in the first instance “to determine what practices [are] unfair.” FTC v.
1

The FTC also brought a distinct claim against Wyndham under the
“deceptive practices” provision. Wyndham does not appeal the district court’s
denial of its motion to dismiss that claim.

Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 405 U.S. 233, 240 (1972). By “intentionally le[aving]
development of the term ‘unfair’ to the Commission,” Atl. Ref. Co. v. FTC, 381
U.S. 357, 367 (1965), Congress gave the FTC broad discretion to “‘prevent such
acts or practices which injuriously affect the general public.’” Am. Fin. Servs.
Ass’n v. FTC, 767 F.2d 957, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 1613,
75th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1937)).2
As Sperry confirms, Congress originally placed no greater constraint on the
FTC’s discretion to determine whether business practices are “unfair” than it
placed on the discretion of other agencies to determine, for example, whether
common carrier practices are “just and reasonable” (e.g., 47 U.S.C. § 201(b)). See
Argument § I, infra. In 1980, responding to “criticism of the vagueness and
breadth of the unfairness doctrine,” American Financial, 767 F.2d at 969, the FTC
issued a policy statement limiting the scope of unfair practices to business conduct
that causes consumers substantial injury that they cannot reasonably avoid and that

As initially enacted in 1914, Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibited only
“unfair methods of competition.” 38 Stat. 719. In 1938, Congress broadened
Section 5 to also cover “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce,” 52
Stat. 111. The 1938 amendment is now the main source of the FTC’s consumer
protection authority (as distinct from its antitrust authority). Congress’s intent
“was affirmatively to grant the Commission authority to protect consumers as well
as competitors.” American Financial, 767 F.2d at 966. The term “unfair” thus
means the same in the 1938 amendments as in the original 1914 enactment. See
Sperry, 405 U.S. at 244.

has no countervailing benefit. Policy Statement on Unfairness (Dec. 17, 1980)
(appended to Int’l Harvester Co., 104 F.T.C. 949, 1070 (1984)).
In 1994, Congress codified the Policy Statement in Section 5(n) of the FTC
Act. See H.R. Rep. 103-617 at 12 (1994). Like the Policy Statement, Section 5(n)
specifies that an act or practice may be deemed unfair only if it “[1] causes or is
likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is [2] not reasonably
avoidable by consumers themselves and [3] not outweighed by countervailing
benefits to consumers or to competition.” 15 U.S.C. § 45(n). That three-part costbenefit test “is the most precise definition of unfairness articulated by either the
Commission or Congress.” American Financial, 767 F.2d at 972.

The FTC’s Data-Security Program

The FTC has addressed online threats to consumers “for almost as long as
there has been an online marketplace.”3 To that end, the agency engages in a
variety of educational and enforcement activities, including actions directed at
protecting consumer data.
In 2007, for example, the FTC published a guidance manual for businesses
cataloguing reasonable data-security practices. See Protecting Personal
Information: A Guide for Business (2007) (“Business Guide”) (copy attached).

The Business Guide advised companies to “[i]dentify the computers or servers
where sensitive personal information is stored,” and to “[i]dentify all connections
to the computers where you store sensitive information.” Id. at 9. It recommended
“encrypting sensitive information that is stored on your computer network,” id. at
10, and warned that “[w]hen installing new software, immediately change vendor
supplied default passwords to a more secure strong password,” id. at 13.
Companies also should “implement policies for installing vendor-approved patches
to correct [security] problems.” Id. at 10.
The Business Guide further explained that computer networks should “[u]se
a firewall to protect [a] computer from hacker attacks while it is connected to the
Internet.” Id. at 14. Specifically, if “some computers on your network store
sensitive information while others do not, consider using additional firewalls to
protect the computers with sensitive information.” Id. Companies should also
“consider using an intrusion detection system” to alert them to security breaches,
id. at 15, and should “[k]eep an eye out for activity from new users, multiple log-in
attempts from unknown users or computers,” id. at 16.
The Business Guide reflected the Commission’s enforcement actions against
individual companies, which spelled out for the business community the types of
data-security deficiencies that could trigger Section 5 liability. For example, the
FTC charged retailer BJ’s Wholesale Club with unfair practices after hackers stole

customer information from the company’s computers and used it to make
fraudulent purchases. According to the complaint, BJ’s had acted unreasonably by
failing to encrypt data, change default passwords, detect intrusions, or conduct
security investigations. See BJ’s Wholesale Club, 140 F.T.C. 465, 467 ¶7 (Sept.
20, 2005).4 The Commission explained that, for purposes of Section 5(n), the
“failure to employ reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect
personal information and files caused or is likely to cause substantial injury to
consumers that is not offset by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition
and is not reasonably avoidable by consumers.” Id. at 468 ¶9. After the parties
decided to settle, the FTC sought public comment on a proposed consent judgment
via Federal Register notice, see 70 Fed. Reg. 36939 (June 27, 2005). After
receiving and considering comments, the agency approved the judgment,
announced it in the press, and placed it and other case materials on the agency’s
website.
Between 2005 and 2008—the period just before Wyndham’s security
breaches—the Commission brought similar cases against at least eight other
companies. As in BJ’s, the Commission charged that the eight companies had
failed to take reasonable data security measures, including data encryption,

intrusion detection, and the use of secure passwords and firewalls.5 An explanation
of the consent order in each matter was published in the Federal Register, approved
by the Commission, announced in the press, and placed (along with other case
materials) on the FTC’s website.
These enforcement initiatives continue. In early 2014, the FTC announced
its 50th data-security settlement. See Statement Marking the FTC’s 50th Data
Security Settlement (Jan. 31, 2014) (“50th Settlement Statement”),
www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/140131gmrstatement.pdf. As the FTC
has emphasized, the FTC Act “does not require perfect security,” and “the mere
fact that a breach occurred does not mean that a company has violated the law.”

is reasonableness.” Id.

Wyndham’s Data-Security Lapses

As part of its hotel business, Wyndham operates a computer network that
connects its own data center with the “property management system” computers
that it manages at Wyndham-branded hotels. First Amended Complaint (“Cmplt.”)
¶¶13-19 (JA61-63).6 The property management systems “handle[] reservations …
and … payment card transactions” and “store personal information about
consumers, including names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers,
payment card account numbers, expiration dates, and security codes.” Id. ¶15
(JA62). Wyndham requires each hotel to purchase the property management
system and configure it to Wyndham’s specifications. Id. ¶15 (JA62). Wyndham
manages each property management system and has exclusive “administrator
access” to system controls, which includes establishing password requirements. Id.
¶17 (JA62-63). The individual property management systems are linked to a
corporate network, housed at a data center in Phoenix, Arizona. Id. ¶16 (JA62).
As Wyndham informed its customers on its website, it has long
“recognize[d] the importance of protecting the privacy” of personal information.
Cmplt. ¶21 (JA64) (quoting Wyndham’s privacy policy). Since at least 2008,
Wyndham has assured its customers that it “safeguard[s] … [c]ustomers’

As used in this brief, “Wyndham” refers collectively to the four corporate
entities named in the complaint. See Cmplt. Ex.A (JA78). Wyndham does not
argue that the formal separateness of those entities is relevant to any issue on
appeal. See Br. n.3.

personally identifiable information by using industry standard practices,” including
“commercially reasonable efforts to make … collection of such [i]nformation
consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.” Id. The company promised to
“utilize a variety of different security measures designed to protect” customer
information, such as encrypting data, as well as “commercially reasonable efforts
to create and maintain ‘fire walls’ and other appropriate safeguards” to protect
customer data. Id.
Although Wyndham explicitly recognized its obligation to take reasonable
steps to secure its customers’ personal information, it failed to do so during the
period relevant here. Among other things, Wyndham left customer data
unprotected by firewalls; did not encrypt credit card information; used outdated
software that could not receive security updates; used widely known default
passwords and easily guessed passwords instead of complex passwords; failed to
keep track of the computers connected to its network; and failed to employ
reasonable measures for detecting and preventing intrusions. Cmplt. ¶24 (JA6567). As a result, hackers infiltrated Wyndham’s computer network three separate
times between 2008 and 2010 and stole customer data each time.
Breach No. 1 (April 2008). The first breach involved a “brute force” attack
from a local hotel network connected to the Wyndham property management
system at the hotel. The intruders used this connection to try usernames and
10

Case: 14-3514

Document: 003111786127

passwords repeatedly until they were able to compromise an administrator account
on the Wyndham network. Cmplt. ¶26 (JA68). That was possible because
Wyndham violated basic data-security norms by using default or other easily
guessed passwords. Id. ¶24(f) (JA66-67).
Three additional security lapses then enabled the hackers to gain access to
customer data on computers throughout Wyndham’s network. First, the hackers’
initial brute-force attack had caused numerous user accounts to be “locked out” as
the hackers moved from account to account trying to guess the passwords needed
for entry into the wider network. The widespread locking out of accounts is “a
well-known warning sign that a computer network is being attacked.” Cmplt. ¶27
(JA68-69). Wyndham knew that account lockouts were occurring. But because it
had no inventory of connected computers, it could not determine and quarantine
the location of the breach. Id.
Second, the property management server used outdated software that its
developer no longer supported, and it therefore lacked three years of security
updates. Cmplt. ¶29 (JA69). Wyndham knew about the vulnerability but allowed
the server, which it controlled, to connect to its network anyway. Id. Third,
Wyndham did not use firewalls to “limit access between and among the
Wyndham-branded hotels’ property management systems, [Wyndham’s] own
corporate network, and the Internet.” Id. ¶28 (JA69). Thus, once the hackers had
11

Case: 14-3514

Document: 003111786127

Page: 25

Date Filed: 11/05/2014

the administrator account password, “they were able to gain unfettered access” to
the property management servers—and the personal data stored there—in many
hotels. Id.
On top of these lapses, yet another security flaw gave the intruders direct
access to customer data. Several property management servers, controlled by
Wyndham, stored consumer credit card information “in clear readable text” rather
than an encrypted format. Cmplt. ¶31 (JA69-70). The intruders were thus able to
steal unencrypted information for more than 500,000 credit card accounts, export it
to Russia, and facilitate fraudulent charges totaling millions of dollars. Id. ¶32
(JA70).
Breach No. 2 (March 2009). The second breach occurred at the Phoenix
data center in March 2009, just six months after Wyndham learned of the first
breach. Cmplt. ¶33 (JA70-71). The hackers gained access to nearly 40 property
management servers on the network. Id. Wyndham did not discover the new
breach because it had failed to monitor its network for the presence of malicious
software used in the first attack. Id. The second attack used the same software, but
in the absence of network monitoring, Wyndham did not learn of the second attack
until it began receiving complaints of unauthorized charges to customer credit
cards two months later. Id. In the interim, the data thieves stole more than 50,000

consumers’ unencrypted credit card account data, which again enabled fraudulent
charges on those accounts. Id. ¶¶35-36 (JA71).
Breach No. 3 (late 2009). Despite the two earlier incidents, by late 2009
Wyndham had not properly implemented firewalls. Wyndham also was not able to
detect the breach in real time. Cmplt. ¶37-38 (JA71-72). Those failures enabled
hackers to break undetected into Wyndham’s network yet a third time. As before,
the breach of an administrator account allowed the infiltrators “to access multiple
… servers” across the network. Id. ¶37 (JA71-72). About 69,000 card numbers
were stolen. Id. ¶39 (JA72).
In total, the three breaches led to “the compromise of more than 619,000
consumer payment card account numbers, the exportation of many of those
account numbers to a domain registered in Russia, fraudulent charges on many
consumers’ accounts, and more than $10.6 million in fraud loss.” Cmplt. ¶40
(JA73).

Proceedings Below

The FTC’s complaint separately charged Wyndham with both “unfair” and
“deceptive” practices. Cmplt. ¶¶44-49 (JA73-74). Wyndham moved to dismiss
the complaint on three grounds pertinent to the unfair-practices claim at issue here.
It argued (1) that Section 5 does not authorize the FTC to bring an unfairness claim
for unreasonable data-security practices; (2) that the FTC had not provided fair
13

Case: 14-3514

Document: 003111786127

Page: 27

Date Filed: 11/05/2014

notice of the security standards required under Section 5; and (3) that the complaint
did not allege facts sufficient to show harm to consumers as required by Section
5(n). Dkt. Entry 91-1 (April 26, 2013).
The district court denied the motion to dismiss in a 42-page opinion. It first
declined Wyndham’s “invitation to carve out a data-security exception to the
FTC’s unfairness authority.” Opinion 10 (JA11). And it rejected Wyndham’s
claim that Congress signaled an intent that the FTC Act does not apply to data
security when it enacted more recent legislation addressing that field. As discussed
below, the new legislation directs the FTC (and other agencies) to adopt specific
data-security requirements in particular areas, grants the FTC streamlined
rulemaking authority it would otherwise lack, and expands the range of available
remedies. As the district court explained, this “subsequent data-security legislation
seems to complement—not preclude—the FTC’s authority” under the FTC Act.
Id. 11 (JA12).
The district court next held that Wyndham had fair notice that it could be
held liable under the FTC Act, just as it could be held liable under ordinary tort
principles, if it unreasonably exposed consumers to harm by negligently handling
their confidential data. Wyndham had argued that the FTC had not published rules
or regulations detailing the data-security practices a company must adopt. The
district court explained, however, that the FTC was not required to issue rules

Case: 14-3514

governing data security before it could bring an enforcement action for unfair datasecurity practices. It found that Wyndham had adequate notice from the FTC’s
Business Guide and prior enforcement cases, which “constitute a body of
experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly
resort for guidance.” Opinion 24 (JA25). Indeed, Wyndham’s references on its
website to “commercially reasonable” data-security practices indicated that the
company understood the need to take reasonable data-security measures. Id.
Finally, the court held that the complaint “adequately pleads ‘substantial
injury to consumers’” necessary to state an unfairness claim. Opinion 26 (JA27).
The agency “alleges that at least some consumers suffered financial injury that
included ‘unreimbursed financial injury’ and, drawing inferences in favor of the
FTC, the alleged injury to consumers is substantial.” Id. at 27 (JA28). The court
stressed that it was merely denying a motion to dismiss, not “render[ing] a decision
on liability.” Id. at 7 (JA8).
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
1. Consumers routinely provide businesses with sensitive information,
including social security numbers, credit card information, and medical records.
Once consumers turn such information over, they lose any ability to keep it secure.
They must depend on merchants to take reasonable precautions to keep
confidential personal data from falling into the wrong hands. This does not mean,
15

Case: 14-3514

Document: 003111786127

Page: 29

as Wyndham and its amici suggest, that the FTC deems any data breach to arise
from an “unfair act or practice.” As the Commission has explained, “the mere fact
that such breaches occurred, standing alone, would not necessarily establish that [a
company] engaged in ‘unfair acts or practices.’ … There is no such thing as perfect
security, and breaches can happen even when a company has taken every
reasonable precaution.”7 But that does not excuse businesses from greatly
increasing the risk of data theft by ignoring basic security measures and
unreasonably exposing sensitive consumer data to thieves. Such fundamental
mistreatment of consumers is precisely the type of unfair practice that Congress
enacted Section 5 to prohibit. Wyndham’s contrary position would leave all
consumers more vulnerable to data breaches and identity theft.
Although Congress did not foresee modern electronic commerce when it
enacted the relevant provisions of the FTC Act, it understood that threats to
consumer welfare would evolve as rapidly as the worlds of business and
technology. It thus wrote Section 5 in open-ended terms, granting the FTC broad
authority to pursue unfair practices across a broad range of economic contexts.
Wyndham contends that a company cannot commit an “unfair act or practice”

unless it deliberately undertakes an “unscrupulous or unethical” course of action
(Br. 20) and argues that unreasonably exposing consumers to third-party threats
cannot qualify as “unfair.” But this argument contradicts the statutory text and
structure and collides with decades of contrary judicial precedent. See, e.g., FTC v.
Neovi, Inc., 604 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir. 2010); American Financial, 767 F.2d 957. As
that precedent confirms, a company can be liable for unfair practices if, like
Wyndham, it unreasonably exposes consumers to substantial injury they cannot
reasonably avoid, regardless of whether the company specifically intends the injury
or whether intervening third-party wrongdoers are involved.
Wyndham is also wrong to argue that recent cybersecurity legislation
“would be inexplicable if the Commission already had general substantive
authority over this field.” Br. 25. In fact, that legislation is consistent with the
FTC’s existing general authority and supplements it in several critical respects,
which Wyndham ignores. Wyndham’s reliance on FDA v. Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120 (2000), is similarly misplaced. Unlike the FDA’s
attempt to regulate tobacco, which contradicted overwhelming evidence of
contrary congressional intent, this FTC enforcement action comports fully with the
FTC Act. In particular, it follows Congress’s clear intent that the general statutory
ban on unfair practices should apply to new types of consumer harm that Congress
could not have foreseen in 1938.

Finally, the Commission determined earlier this year in LabMD that
Section 5 applies to data-security lapses. That adjudicative ruling is entitled to
Chevron deference. Wyndham opposes such deference on the sole ground that the
agency’s interpretation raises nondelegation concerns. But that nondelegation
argument is meritless because, among other considerations, the criteria set forth in
Section 5(n) plainly supply an “intelligible principle” for the exercise of agency
discretion.
2. Wyndham also argues that this enforcement action violates due process
because “the FTC has never provided any guidance” concerning reasonable datasecurity measures. Br. 35-36. That argument is untenable for multiple reasons.
First, under ordinary common-law negligence principles, businesses are
always on notice that they must take commercially reasonable measures to protect
consumers from foreseeable harm, whether or not the details of that responsibility
are codified. Wyndham would have no fair-notice objection to a private tort suit
alleging negligent data-security practices, and it likewise cannot plausibly object to
this Section 5 suit, which alleges breach of the same duty of care.
Moreover, the FTC has in fact provided extensive guidance to industry
concerning the elements of reasonable data security. Before the events at issue, the
Commission found that a number of specific companies had acted unreasonably by
failing to take many of the same data-security precautions that Wyndham neglected
18

Case: 14-3514

Document: 003111786127

Page: 32

Date Filed: 11/05/2014

here. It is irrelevant that those determinations appeared as part of consent decrees.
Wyndham is complaining that the FTC failed to provide notice of its views on
reasonable data security, and the consent decrees conveyed the agency’s views
whether or not they were reviewed by courts. In addition, the Commission’s 2007
Business Guide identified basic precautions that companies should take to protect
consumers. Again, Wyndham simply ignored many of these elementary
precautions, to the detriment of its customers.
3. Finally, the FTC’s complaint pleads sufficient facts to demonstrate
“substantial injury” for purposes of Section 5(n). The complaint alleges several
distinct forms of injury, including unreimbursed charges, impaired access to credit,
and the time and money consumers wasted cleaning up the mess caused by
Wyndham’s repeated security lapses. Each of these allegations independently
states a “substantial injury” that amply satisfies applicable pleading requirements.
ARGUMENT

A COMPANY’S FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REASONABLE DATA-SECURITY
PRACTICES CONSTITUTES AN “UNFAIR ACT OR PRACTICE”
A.

Congress Deliberately Kept Section 5(a) Broad, Subject Only To
The Cost-Benefit Analysis Of Section 5(n)

Section 5(a) of the FTC Act broadly prohibits, and authorizes the FTC to
prevent, all “unfair … acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” 15 U.S.C.
§ 45(a). In the Supreme Court’s words, Congress “intentionally left development
of the term ‘unfair’ to the Commission rather than attempting to define” any

specific practices. Atlantic Refining, 381 U.S. at 367 (quoting S. Rep. No. 63-597
at 13 (1914)). Congress had a “crystal clear” intent that the term should have
“sweep and flexibility,” Sperry, 405 U.S. at 241, and should remain “a flexible
concept with evolving content,” FTC v. Bunte Bros., Inc., 312 U.S. 349, 353
(1941); accord In re Smith, 866 F.2d 576, 581 (3d Cir. 1989) (“[s]tatutes
prohibiting unfair trade practices and acts have routinely been interpreted to be
flexible and adaptable to respond to human inventiveness”).
The evidence of that congressional intent is extensive. “When Congress
created the Federal Trade Commission in 1914 and charted its power and
responsibility…, it explicitly considered, and rejected, the notion that it reduce the
ambiguity of the phrase ‘unfair methods of competition’ … by enumerating the
particular practices to which it was intended to apply.” Sperry, 405 U.S. at 239240 (citing S. Rep. No. 63-597 at 13); see also note 2 supra (describing
relationship between “unfair methods” (1914) and “unfair practices” (1938)
provisions). Thus, instead of “attempt[ing] to define the many and variable unfair
practices which prevail in commerce and to forbid their continuance,” Congress
adopted “a general declaration condemning unfair practices” and “le[ft] it to the
commission to determine what practices were unfair.” S. Rep. 63-597 at 13.
“[T]here were too many unfair practices to define, and after writing 20 of them into
the law it would be quite possible to invent others.” Id. As the House Conference

Report put it, “[i]t is impossible to frame definitions which embrace all unfair
practices. There is no limit to human inventiveness in this field. Even if all known
unfair practices were specifically defined and prohibited, it would be at once
necessary to begin over again.” American Financial, 767 F.2d at 966 (quoting
H.R. Rep. No. 63-1142 at 19 (1914) (Conf. Rep.)).
In short, Congress “expressly declined to delineate” the “particular acts or
practices” deemed unfair, American Financial, 767 F.2d at 969, preferring instead
to give the FTC “broad discretionary authority … to define unfair practices on a
flexible and incremental basis,” id. at 967. As a result, courts have “adopted a
malleable view of the Commission’s authority” to interpret and apply the term
“unfair.” Id. at 967-968. “Neither the language nor the history of the [FTC] [A]ct
suggests that Congress intended to confine” the concept of unfairness to “fixed and
unyielding categories.” FTC v. R.F. Keppel & Bro., Inc., 291 U.S. 304, 310
(1934). Of course “[t]he Commission’s exercise of its unfairness authority in any
particular instance is subject to judicial review,” American Financial, 767 F.2d at
968, but courts extend “deference to the Commission’s informed judgment that a
particular commercial practice is to be condemned as ‘unfair,’” FTC v. Indiana
Fed’n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 454 (1986).
With judicial approval, the FTC has invoked Section 5’s prohibition on
unfair practices against many disparate types of conduct that harm consumers with

no countervailing benefits. These practices have included not only outright fraud,
but also breaching of contracts, Orkin Exterminating Co. v. FTC, 849 F.2d 1354
(11th Cir. 1988), taking security interests in household goods, American Financial,
767 F.2d 957, commencing lawsuits against consumers in inconvenient forums,
Spiegel, Inc. v. FTC, 540 F.2d 287 (7th Cir. 1976), and negligently failing to warn
consumers of product defects, Int’l Harvester Co., 104 F.T.C. at 1070.
Congress has limited the scope of the FTC’s “unfairness” authority only
once: in 1994, when it codified the 1980 Policy Statement by enacting Section
5(n) of the FTC Act. See pp.4-5, supra. Section 5(n) requires the Commission to
consider not only a practice’s harm to consumers, but also its possible benefits.
Specifically, it provides that, in the consumer-protection context, the FTC may
deem an act or practice unfair only if it “causes or is likely to cause substantial
injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves
and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.”
15 U.S.C. § 45(n). That consumer injury test “is the most precise definition of
unfairness articulated by either the Commission or Congress.” American
Financial, 767 F.2d at 972. Congress adopted no other restriction on the types of
practices that fall within the prohibited category.

Wyndham’s “Ordinary English” Argument Is Meritless

For the first time on appeal, Wyndham claims that, “[a]s a matter of ordinary
English” as revealed in the dictionary, “the term ‘unfair’ cannot be stretched to
encompass” a company’s failure to adopt reasonable data-security practices. Br.
18, 20. According to Wyndham, this dictionary definition limits Section 5(a)’s
prohibition to “unscrupulous or unethical behavior” that a company intentionally
inflicts on its own customers. Br. 20-21. Wyndham waived this “ordinary
English” argument by failing to raise it below, and for good reason: the argument
is untenable.
As discussed, Congress, courts, and the Commission have applied Section 5
to ban “unfair practices” in disparate contexts over decades, and they have never
suggested that the term should be limited as Wyndham proposes. That is reason
enough to resist Wyndham’s reliance on dictionary definitions as the principal
source of statutory meaning, unmoored from historical practice. In any event, the
dictionary affirmatively supports the Commission’s interpretation. Like many
common words, “unfair” encompasses several meanings. One is: “[c]ontrary to
laws or conventions, especially in commerce.” American Heritage Dict. of the
English Language 1950 (3d ed. 1992). Companies that, like Wyndham, violate
basic industry norms for protecting confidential consumer data are by definition

acting “[c]ontrary to [the] conventions” of reasonable business practices. See also
§ I.D, infra (addressing Chevron deference).8
Moreover, proper interpretation of Section 5(a) requires reference to
statutory context. As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, Sections 5(a) and 5(n)
should be read in tandem because “the consumer injury test,” adopted by the
Commission in 1980 and now codified in Section 5(n), “is the most precise
definition of unfairness articulated by either the Commission or Congress.”
American Financial, 767 F.2d at 972. Like statutory prohibitions on “unjust” or
“unreasonable” utility practices, e.g., 47 U.S.C. §§ 201, 202, the “unfairness”
prohibition of Section 5(a) is broad, enabling the Commission to “‘prevent such
acts or practices which injuriously affect the general public.’” American
Financial, 767 F.2d at 966 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 1613 at 3). And precisely
because that authority is broad, Congress followed the FTC’s own lead by
8

Wyndham selectively quotes a different definition from another dictionary to
argue that “an ‘unfair’ practice is one ‘marked by injustice, partiality, or
deception.’” Br. 18-19, quoting Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1288
(1988). But the same dictionary gives “not equitable” as a fully independent
meaning of “unfair.” Id. And one dictionary contemporaneous with the passage of
the unfair practices provision lists “[r]easonable” and “equitable” as synonymous.
Webster’s Second New International Dictionary 865 (1934); see id. at 2773
(defining “unfair” to mean, inter alia, “not equitable in business dealings”). Yet
another dictionary lists “unreasonable” as a synonym of “unfair” itself. Oxford
Dictionaries (Oxford University Press), http://www.oxford dictionaries.com/us/
definition/american_english/unfair (visited Nov. 4, 2014). Again, the core claim
here is that Wyndham’s data-security lapses were unfair to consumers because they
were unreasonably harmful.

constraining that authority with—and only with—the cost-benefit analysis codified
in Section 5(n). There is nothing “misguided,” let alone “ironic” (Br. 21), about
reading these two provisions together to understand this statutory scheme as a
whole; that is how statutory interpretation is done. See, e.g., Robinson v. Shell Oil
Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997) (“The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language
is determined by reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that
language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.”).9
Indeed, unreasonably lax data-security practices present a case study in the
proper application of Sections 5(a) and 5(n). In many settings, ranging from
commercial transactions to financial dealings to medical care, consumers place
their private data in the care of businesses. Once they have done so, they can no
longer protect the data themselves. They instead have a legitimate expectation that
the merchant itself will act reasonably to keep their private information safe. A
merchant thwarts that expectation if, like Wyndham, it neglects basic data-security

9

LeBlanc v. Unifund CCR Partners, 601 F.3d 1185 (11th Cir. 2010), cited by
Wyndham (Br. 19), is inapposite. There, the Eleventh Circuit construed the phrase
“unfair or unconscionable” in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and
determined it to be as “vague as they come.” Id. at 1200. The court then relied on
a particular meaning of “unfair” that includes the concept of “deception,” which
was the relevant statutory concern in the deceptive debt-collection practice before
the court. Id. & n.32. The court did not hold that “unfair” is limited to that
meaning and did not address Section 5 of the FTC Act. Section 5 independently
prohibits “deceptive acts or practices,” so construing “unfair” to mean only
“deceptive” would read the “unfairness” prong out of the statute.

conventions and unreasonably—i.e., unfairly—places sensitive customer
information at risk. In that case, the merchant “causes or is likely to cause
substantial injury to consumers,” 15 U.S.C. § 45(n), in the form of monetary loss,
identity theft, and countless hours spent trying to mitigate the damage, among
other harms. Such injuries are not “reasonably avoidable by consumers
themselves” because, as discussed, consumers lose control over their personal
information once they turn it over to merchants. Id. And Wyndham does not even
argue that such harm is “outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to
competition.” Id.
Wyndham further contradicts decades of precedent when it proposes (on the
sole basis of its preferred dictionary definition) to confine the statutory prohibition
to acts undertaken with “unscrupulous or unethical” intent. Br. 20-21.10 The
Commission rejected any such requirement in the 1980 Policy Statement,
explaining that “the theory of immoral or unscrupulous conduct was abandoned
altogether” as an independent basis of liability in assessing whether a company’s
practices were “unfair.” 104 F.T.C. at 1061 n.46. Applying the Policy Statement,
the Commission held in International Harvester that a company’s negligent failure

10

It is doubtful that Wyndham would even benefit from this proposed
limitation on Section 5 liability. Wyndham behaved “unethically” by betraying
consumers’ trust that it would take reasonable measures to protect their financial
data.

Case: 14-3514

to notify consumers about hazards in its product constituted an unfair act or
practice even in the absence of “a deliberate act on the part of the seller.” 104
F.T.C. at 1059. When Congress codified the Policy Statement a decade later, it too
chose not to impose any heightened scienter requirement in unfairness cases.
Wyndham may not add new terms of its choosing to the statute.
Courts have also consistently held that, in the Ninth Circuit’s words,
“consumers are injured for purposes of the Act not solely through the machinations
of those with ill intentions, but also through the actions of those whose practices
facilitate, or contribute to, ill intentioned schemes if the injury was a predictable
consequence of those actions.” Neovi, 604 F.3d at 1156. The Eleventh Circuit
similarly held in Orkin that a breach of contract could constitute an unfair practice,
whether or not it “involve[d] some sort of deceptive or fraudulent behavior.” 849
F.2d at 1363. And the D.C. Circuit held in American Financial that Section 5 is
not limited to “conduct involving deception, coercion or the withholding of
material information.” 767 F.2d at 982; see also id. (“it is not for this court to step
in and confine, by judicial fiat, the Commission’s unfairness authority to acts or
practices found to be deceptive or coercive”); FTC v. Algoma Lumber Co., 291
U.S. 67, 79 (1934) (holding that anticompetitive “motives” are not an element of
liability for an unfair method of competition).

Wyndham likewise contradicts decades of precedent when it argues (again
on the sole basis of its chosen dictionary definition) that a company’s acts can be
unfair only if they directly injure consumers and not if they unreasonably enable
third parties to harm consumers. Br. 20-21. As both the Supreme Court and this
Court have held, a business can be liable under Section 5 even if it merely
“furnishes another with the means of consummating a fraud.” FTC v. Winsted
Hosiery Co., 258 U.S. 483, 494 (1922); accord Regina Corp. v. FTC, 322 F.2d
765, 768 (3d Cir. 1963) (“[o]ne who places in the hands of another a means of
consummating a fraud … is himself guilty of a violation of the [FTC] Act”)
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
In Neovi, for example, the Ninth Circuit held that a defendant can be liable
for “unfair practices” even though its own actions merely “facilitated fraud” and
the ultimate harm to consumers flowed from “the contribution of independent
causal agents.” 604 F.3d at 1155. The defendant in that case offered a service
enabling users to create checks drawn on bank accounts, but failed to institute
safeguards to ensure that account owners had authorized payment of such checks.
Thieves used the service to make fraudulent withdrawals. Like Wyndham here,
the defendant argued that it committed no unfair practice because it did not itself
perpetrate fraud on consumers; instead, it protested, it was guilty only of creating a
service that third parties misused. The court rejected this argument on the ground
28

Case: 14-3514

Document: 003111786127

that it “ignores the fact that [the defendant] created and controlled a system that
facilitated fraud and that the company was on notice as to the high fraud rate.” Id.
at 1155. It added: the “absence of deceit is not dispositive. Nor is actual
knowledge of the harm a requirement under the Act.” Id. at 1156. Similarly here,
Wyndham created and controlled a computer network that collected private data,
yet it repeatedly failed to take reasonable steps to protect that network against data
theft, even after its system was repeatedly breached. Wyndham’s “third party
wrongdoer” rationale for avoiding liability would contradict the central holding of
Neovi.11
Finally, Wyndham protests that “any injury to consumers is derivative of the
injury to [Wyndham] itself” and that Wyndham “certainly ha[d] no incentive to
tolerate … crimes against itself.” Br. 21. But Sections 5(a) and 5(n) contain no
exemption for a business that exposes itself to harm through negligence at the same
time that it injures consumers. The very premise of commercial liability for
negligence is that a company’s incentives to take reasonable precautions to protect
11

As in Neovi, the Commission often brings unfairness enforcement actions
against defendants that may not themselves have intended to harm consumers but
that unreasonably exposed consumers to harm inflicted by third parties. For
example, the agency recently brought “cramming” cases alleging that mobile
phone companies, which acted as billing conduits, unreasonably enabled third
parties to place fraudulent charges on customer bills for services that customers did
not order. See FTC v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., No. 2:14-cv-967 (W.D. Wash.)
(complaint filed July 1, 2014); FTC v. AT&T Mobility, LLC, No. 1:14-cv-3227
(N.D. Ga.) (complaint and proposed stipulated order filed Oct. 8, 2014).

consumers are poorly aligned with the interests of consumers themselves, as were
Wyndham’s here.
C.

Recent Cybersecurity Legislation Supplements, Rather Than
Displaces, FTC Authority Under Section 5

Wyndham next argues that various recent cybersecurity statutes preclude the
inference that Congress thought the FTC could use its Section 5 authority to
address cybersecurity. According to Wyndham, these statutes “would be
inexplicable if the Commission already had general substantive authority over this
field.” Br. 25. That is wrong for reasons that the district court explained, Opinion
10-12 (JA11-13), and Wyndham largely ignores.
In several substantive and procedural respects, the recent legislation
supplements the FTC’s general authority to proceed under Section 5 against
unreasonably lax data-security measures as unfair practices. First, the laws give
the Commission streamlined rulemaking authority it otherwise lacks under the
FTC Act. For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), 113 Stat. 1338
(1999), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), 117 Stat. 1952 (2003), and the
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), 112 Stat. 2681, all
enable the Commission to adopt data-protection rules using notice-and-comment
rulemaking procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act. 15 U.S.C.
§ 1681s(a)(1) (FCRA); 15 U.S.C. § 6804(a)(1) (GLBA); 15 U.S.C. § 6502(b)
(COPPA). In the absence of that APA authority, any Commission rulemaking
30

Case: 14-3514

Document: 003111786127

Page: 44

proceedings in this area would be subject to the cumbersome (and thus rarely used)
Magnuson-Moss procedures, which require full-blown evidentiary hearings and
witness testimony. See 15 U.S.C. § 57a.
Second, the recent legislation augments the remedies the Commission can
seek in data-security enforcement actions. For example, the FCRA and COPPA
empower the Commission to seek civil penalties, whereas the FTC Act generally
entitles the FTC to pursue only equitable remedies. 15 U.S.C. § 1681s(a)(2)
(FCRA); 15 U.S.C. § 6505(d) (COPPA); compare 15 U.S.C. §§ 45(b), 53(b) (FTC
Act).
Third, all three statutes authorize the FTC to obtain relief even when it
cannot demonstrate substantial consumer injury. 15 U.S.C. § 1681s(a) (FCRA); 15
U.S.C. §§ 6801(b), 6805(a)(7) (GLBA); 15 U.S.C. § 6505(d) (COPPA).
Fourth, the more recent legislation affirmatively requires the FTC (and other
agencies) to address policy concerns in specific areas where the FTC already had
discretionary authority to act. Congress commonly authorizes agencies to oversee
entire fields and later specifies, in a few areas, minimum steps those agencies must
take in exercising that authority. Such legislation does not detract from the
agencies’ broader authority. See, e.g., Cablevision Sys. Corp. v. FCC, 649 F.3d
695, 705-706 (D.C. Cir. 2011).

In all of these respects, the subsequent laws supplement the FTC’s
preexisting authority, as the district court recognized. Opinion 11 (JA12); see also
LabMD Order 9-13. There is thus no basis for Wyndham’s suggestion that these
laws somehow “presuppose the absence … of pre-existing substantive authority in
this area.” Br. 26.
For similar reasons, this case bears no resemblance to Brown & Williamson,
529 U.S. at 125, on which Wyndham heavily relies. There, the Supreme Court
held that the Food and Drug Administration lacked authority to regulate tobacco
under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because the exercise of authority under
that general statute would have contradicted more recent statutes pertaining
specifically to tobacco. For example, the Court observed that, if the FDA had such
jurisdiction, its own findings would have forced it to prohibit tobacco products
altogether, thereby clashing with tobacco-specific statutes confirming that
Congress did not wish to ban such products. See id. at 137-39. That and other
statutory conflicts indicated Congress’s intent to “clearly preclude[] the FDA from
asserting jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products.” Id. at 126. In contrast,
Wyndham “can cite no similar congressional intent to preserve inadequate data-

32

Case: 14-3514

security practices that unreasonably injure consumers.” LabMD Order at 6;
accord Opinion 10 (JA11).12
The Brown & Williamson Court also found it “extremely unlikely that
Congress could have intended to place tobacco within the ambit of the FDCA
absent any discussion of the matter,” given “the economic and political
significance of the tobacco industry at the time.” 529 U.S. at 147. No
corresponding inference could be drawn here. When Congress enacted the
prohibition on unfair practices in 1938, it obviously could not have anticipated the
“economic and political significance” of data-security practices in the modern
digital economy, and thus could not have intended to keep the FTC from
addressing those practices. To the contrary, Congress intended to delegate broad
authority to the FTC to address emerging business practices, including those that
were unforeseeable when the statute was enacted. See Section I.A, supra.
Absent an affirmative conflict between the FTC Act and the more recent
statutes, Wyndham’s reliance on those statutes for evidence of congressional intent

12

Wyndham’s reliance on Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 134 S. Ct. 2427
(2014), is likewise unfounded. There, EPA’s interpretation of its organic act was
“inconsistent with—in fact, would overthrow—the Act’s structure and design,” id.
at 2442, and would be “incompatible” with “the substance of Congress’ regulatory
scheme,” id. at 2443 (citing Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 156). Indeed, EPA
itself acknowledged that its interpretation “would render the statute
‘unrecognizable to the Congress that designed’ it.” 134 S. Ct. at 2445. The
opposite is true here
33

Case: 14-3514

underlying the FTC Act falls flat. As the Supreme Court has explained, “later
enacted laws” have little interpretive value where, as here, they “do not declare the
meaning of earlier law,” “do not seek to clarify an earlier enacted general term,”
“do not depend for their effectiveness upon clarification, or a change in the
meaning of an earlier statute,” and “do not reflect any direct focus by Congress
upon the meaning of the earlier enacted provisions.” Almendarez-Torres v. United
States, 523 U.S. 224, 237 (1998) (citations omitted). In such circumstances,
subsequent legislation cannot be used as a “forward looking legislative mandate,
guidance, or direct suggestion about how courts should interpret the earlier
provisions.” Id.13
Wyndham cites no case to the contrary. Every precedent on which it relies
(Br. 25-26) involved a later-enacted statute that conflicted with the earlier statute.
In United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988), for example, the Court held that
preservation of a prior statutory interpretation “would undermine” more recent
legislation. Id. at 451. Even then, the Court took pains to point out that “it can be
strongly presumed that Congress will specifically address language on the statute
books that it wishes to change.” Id. at 453. Similarly, United States v. Estate of

13

In contrast, as discussed above, Section 5(n) does cast strong interpretive
light on Section 5(a) because Congress enacted that provision for the express
purpose of clarifying the Commission’s discretion under Section 5(a). See Section
I.B, supra.

Romani, 523 U.S. 517 (1998), involved a “plain inconsistency” between statutes.
Id. at 520. Wyndham improperly relies (Br. 26) on an out-of-context quote from
Romani that addresses the construction of otherwise irreconcilable statutes, and not
statutes that (like those here) are consistent. The maxim that a court must “make
sense rather than nonsense” of the law, Br. 26, quoting W. Va. Univ. Hosps., Inc. v.
Casey, 499 U.S. 83, 101 (1991), applies only when statutes conflict.
This case more closely resembles Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497
(2007). There, the Supreme Court read the Clean Air Act broadly to cover carbon
dioxide emissions as “air pollutants” despite subsequent legislation addressing
climate change. The Court distinguished Brown & Williamson on the ground that
the later acts do not “conflict[] in any way” with the earlier statute and thus
provided no basis to narrow the existing law. Id. at 531. Similarly here, Wyndham
cannot “explain how the FTC’s unfairness authority over data security would lead
to a result that is incompatible with” data-security statutes later passed by
Congress. Opinion 10 (JA11).
It is also immaterial that Congress has recently considered, but has not
enacted, legislation that would grant the FTC new remedial tools and would direct
it, among other things, to promulgate general rules covering data security. Br. 2930. Those unenacted bills, like the statutes Congress actually did pass, merely
would have supplemented the FTC’s existing Section 5 authority and thus would

not have cast doubt on that authority even had they been enacted. Equally
important, “a proposal that does not become law” is “a particularly dangerous
ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute.” Pension Benefit Guar.
Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 650 (1990). “Congressional inaction lacks
persuasive significance because several equally tenable inferences may be drawn
from such inaction including the inference that the existing legislation already
incorporated the offered change.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted);

States v. Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U.S. 157, 170 (1968) (failed requests for
legislation do not prove agency “did not already possess” authority). Indeed,
several of the bills included savings clauses to preserve the FTC’s existing datasecurity authority. See S. 1207, 112th Cong. § 6(d) (1st Sess. 2011); H.R. 2577,
112 Cong. § 6(d) (1st Sess. 2011); H.R. 1841, 112 Cong. § 6(d) (1st Sess. 2011);
H.R. 1707, 112 Cong. § 6(d) (1st Sess. 2011).
There similarly is no merit to Wyndham’s claim that “the Commission’s
interpretation of Section 5 is inconsistent with its repeated efforts to obtain from
Congress the very authority it purports to wield here.” Br. 28-29. Wyndham cites
the testimony of FTC officials in support of legislation that would give the
Commission new powers in the data-security area. But that testimony contradicts
Wyndham’s argument. As those officials explained, such new legislation would

usefully supplement the FTC’s existing data-security authority. The officials
nowhere suggested that the FTC currently lacks such authority and needs
legislation to fill the void.14

The Commission’s Interpretation of Section 5 Is Entitled To
Chevron Deference

Earlier this year, the Commission addressed these same statutory-authority
issues in an administrative proceeding involving LabMD, a medical-testing
company charged with insufficiently protecting patient medical records from
hackers. LabMD, like Wyndham here, asserted that inadequate data-security
measures cannot constitute “unfair practices” under Section 5. Sitting in its
capacity as an administrative tribunal, the Commission rejected that claim,
unanimously determining that its “authority to protect consumers from unfair
practices relating to deficient data security measures is well-supported by the FTC
Act.” LabMD Order 3.
The Commission’s determination that its authority under the “unfair
practices” provision of Section 5 extends to data-security practices is entitled to

For example, Commissioner (now Chairwoman) Ramirez referred to “the
FTC Act’s proscription against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in cases …
where [a business’s] failure to employ reasonable security measures causes or is
likely to cause substantial consumer injury.” 2011 WL 2358081 (June 15, 2011).
David Vladeck, then-Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, testified that
unfairness authority extends to “cases where … [a] failure to employ reasonable
security measures causes or is likely to cause substantial consumer injury.” 2011
WL 1971214 (May 4, 2011).

substantial deference. “Where the Congress has provided that an administrative
agency initially apply a broad statutory term to a particular situation, [the
reviewing court’s] function is limited to determining whether the Commission’s
decision has warrant in the record and a reasonable basis in law.” Atlantic
Refining, 381 U.S. at 367 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Specifically,
under Chevron, if “Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at
issue,” and if “the agency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of the
statute”—as it is here—a reviewing court must yield to that construction.
Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-843. The Supreme Court recently confirmed “that
Chevron applies to cases in which an agency adopts a construction of a
jurisdictional provision of a statute it administers,” City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC,
133 S. Ct. 1863, 1871 (2013), and reaffirmed that deference extends to agency
adjudicatory decisions that, like LabMD, are issued pursuant to statutory authority,
id. at 1874.
In response, Wyndham does not argue that Congress has “directly addressed
the precise question at issue” or that deference is unwarranted under Chevron
“Step One.” Instead, Wyndham asserts only that Section 5 must be construed
narrowly to avoid “a serious non-delegation question” (Br. 34) and that this
“doctrine of constitutional avoidance” trumps any deference due to agency
statutory interpretations (Br. 32). But the constitutional-avoidance canon applies

only where an agency’s interpretation poses “serious” constitutional concerns.
See, e.g., Verizon Commc’ns v. FCC, 535 U.S. 467, 523 (2002). Wyndham’s
nondelegation argument is simply implausible, which likely explains why
Wyndham did not raise it below.
As this Court has recognized, “[u]nder modern application of the
nondelegation doctrine, as long as Congress ‘lay[s] down by legislative act an
intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to exercise the
delegated authority is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden
delegation of legislative power.’” United States v. Cooper, 750 F.3d 263, 270 (3d
Cir. 2014) (quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989)). Indeed,
the Supreme Court “has not invalidated a statute for violating the nondelegation
doctrine in … nearly 80 years,” despite the passage of statutes more open-ended
than Section 5. Id. For example, Congress has authorized the FCC to police “just
and reasonable rates,” 47 U.S.C. § 201(b), and to grant licenses pursuant to the
“public interest,” 47 U.S.C. § 307(a), and it has authorized the National Labor
Relations Board to determine whether employers have engaged in “good faith”
collective bargaining, 29 U.S.C. § 158(d). No one today seriously suggests that
these open-ended standards violate the nondelegation rule. Not surprisingly,
Section 5 itself “has withstood repeated attack on delegation grounds.” Int’l
Harvester, 104 F.T.C. at 1068 & n.67 (citing Nat’l Harness Mfrs.’ Ass’n v. FTC,

268 F. 705 (6th Cir. 1920); Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. FTC, 258 F. 307, 312 (7th Cir.
1919); and T.C. Hurst & Son v. FTC, 268 F. 874 (E.D. Va. 1920)).
Here, Congress has confined unfairness cases to those that satisfy the three
criteria of Section 5(n). That is a clearer and more specific “intelligible principle”
than others found in the many statutory schemes that courts have deemed
constitutional, and by itself it refutes Wyndham’s new-found nondelegation
concern. Section 5(n) similarly undermines Wyndham’s argument that the FTC’s
construction of Section 5 contains no “limiting principle.” Br. 22. The costbenefit test of Section 5(n) supplies Congress’s choice of limiting principles, and
Wyndham identifies no basis for reading new ones into the statute.

WYNDHAM HAD FAIR NOTICE OF ITS OBLIGATION TO TAKE REASONABLE
STEPS TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL CONSUMER DATA
Wyndham claims that it has been denied due process because “the FTC has

never provided any guidance” as to what data-security practices Wyndham should
have implemented. Br. 35-36. That argument is untenable for two independent
reasons. First, the standard of care the FTC is enforcing here reflects basic
negligence principles. All companies are on notice that, even in the absence of
specific written guidance, they must follow commercially reasonable standards of
care. Second, the FTC has warned industry repeatedly to take the basic datasecurity precautions that Wyndham ignored here.

All Companies Have Notice Of Their Obligation To Follow Basic
Standards Of Care

The FTC’s complaint charges Wyndham with violating a duty to act
reasonably in the face of known data-security threats. That duty of care is rooted
as much in common-law negligence principles as in the FTC Act. All businesses
operate under the knowledge that they must act reasonably towards consumers and
that a failure to do so can result in tort liability. Hotels in particular have a duty of
care to “take reasonable action to protect” their guests from harm. Restatement
(Second) of Torts § 314A (1965). Moreover, when Wyndham received
confidential information entrusted to it by its customers, it effectively acted in the
position of a bailee, which must “exercise reasonable and ordinary care” in
protecting the property it has accepted from a bailor. Am. Enka Co. v. Wicaco
Mach. Corp., 686 F.2d 1050, 1053 (3d Cir. 1982) (citations omitted).
Wyndham is no more entitled to detailed written guidance when it is sued by
the FTC for unreasonably exposing consumers to harm than it would be if sued by
private plaintiffs who have suffered harm as a result of the same unreasonable
conduct. As the Commission explained in the LabMD Order, “[e]very day, courts
and juries subject companies to tort liability for violating uncodified standards of
care, and the contexts in which they make those fact-specific judgments are as
varied and fast-changing as the world of commerce and technology itself.” Id. at
17; see Opinion 22 (JA23) (tort liability “is routinely found for unreasonable

conduct without the need for particularized prohibitions”).15 For example, doctors
are often held liable in medical malpractice cases for violating uncodified
standards of care that are established only in after-the-fact expert testimony.
Moreover, when factfinders in tort cases find that corporate defendants have
violated an unwritten rule of conduct, they “can normally impose compensatory
and even punitive damages,” whereas the FTC is generally confined to equitable
remedies. LabMD Order 16. Despite the broad relief available to private
plaintiffs, no one would contend that a trial court violates fair notice principles
when, by applying ordinary duty-of-care principles, it finds that a commercial
defendant has acted negligently by inadequately safeguarding consumers.
Duties to act “reasonably” and to follow similarly general standards of
conduct are ubiquitous in statutory law as well. To name just a few: Restraints of
trade under the Sherman Act are often assessed under a fact-specific “rule of
reason,” see Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 899
(2007), yet violations are subject to automatic treble damages. The FCC polices
the obligation of common carriers to offer “just and reasonable” rates and terms of

Commissioner Joshua Wright wrote the unanimous opinion in LabMD,
which rejected a fair-notice argument identical to Wyndham’s. Wyndham’s
reliance (Br. 38) on an article written by Commissioner Wright to support its
argument that the Commission has provided too little guidance in this area thus is
misplaced. That article addressed Section 5’s antitrust-oriented prohibition on
“unfair methods of competition,” to which the limitations of Section 5(n) do not
apply.

service. 47 U.S.C. § 201(b). Occupational safety regulations use a reasonableperson test to assess the adequacy of safety precautions. Voegele Co., Inc. v.
OSHRC, 625 F.2d 1075, 1078-1079 (3d Cir. 1980). In all of those contexts,
companies can be subject to sanctions under guideposts no more specific than
Section 5.
Wyndham’s claims of surprise ring particularly hollow in light of its
longstanding assurances to customers that it would in fact provide reasonable data
security. Wyndham’s privacy policy assured customers that Wyndham
“safeguard[s] … [c]ustomers’ personally identifiable information by using industry
standard practices,” including “commercially reasonable efforts to make …
collection of such [i]nformation consistent with all applicable laws and
regulations.” Cmplt. ¶21 (JA64) (emphasis added). The company promised to
“utilize a variety of different security measures designed to protect” customer
information, such as encrypting data, as well as “commercially reasonable efforts
to create and maintain ‘fire walls’ and other appropriate safeguards” to protect
private customer data. Id. Those are some of the very precautions that the FTC
alleges Wyndham did not take. Having promised that it would take these
precautions, Wyndham can hardly claim that it lacked notice of its responsibility to
do so.

Wyndham barely responds to any of these points. It argues only that
“common law cannot resolve the fair-notice issue here” because “liability under
the FTC Act is not bounded by the common law.” Br. 40 (citing Sperry, 405 U.S.
at 240-244). But it is immaterial that common law principles do not limit the
FTC’s authority under Section 5 as a general matter. In the complaint challenged
here, the Commission is relying on a standard of care rooted firmly in common law
principles of negligence; indeed, the Section 5(n) factors parallel the basic
considerations that inform tort liability under the same circumstances. Thus, even
apart from the FTC-specific guidance discussed below, those background common
law principles, acknowledged by Wyndham in its data security policy, provided
constitutionally adequate notice of a duty under the FTC Act. That the FTC’s
authority may extend beyond the boundaries of the common law in other respects
does not mean that Wyndham lacked constitutionally adequate notice of a duty to
act reasonably in accordance with generally applicable standards of reasonable
behavior.
B.

The FTC Has Repeatedly Advised Industry To Adopt The Basic
Data-Security Measures That Wyndham Failed To Implement

Even apart from the duty of reasonable care that all businesses must follow,
the FTC has provided constitutionally adequate notice to Wyndham by repeatedly
and publicly advising companies to undertake the basic data-security precautions
that Wyndham failed to take.

Agencies have broad discretion in choosing how to provide “a sufficient,
publicly accessible statement” of a regulatory requirement. Secretary of Labor v.
Beverly Healthcare-Hillview, 541 F.3d 193, 202 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing United
States v. Lachman, 387 F.3d 42, 57 (1st Cir. 2004)). In Star Wireless, LLC v. FCC,
522 F.3d 469, 474 (D.C. Cir. 2008), for example, the D.C. Circuit held that public
announcements sufficiently notified parties of applicable regulatory requirements.
Accord Gen. Elec. Co. v. EPA, 53 F.3d 1324, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (“public
statements” can satisfy notice requirement); Abhe & Svoboda, Inc. v. Chao, 508
F.3d 1052, 1060 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (administrative decisions sufficed). Here, the
FTC gave the public―including Wyndham―ample notice of its data-security
obligations in two different ways: through a series of administrative decisions
finding specific companies liable for inadequate data-security practices, and
through the publication of the Business Guide in 2007.
1.

The Commission’s Complaints and Consent Judgments Identified
The Basic Data-Security Obligations That Wyndham Neglected

Beginning in 2005, the Commission has issued numerous complaints and
consent decrees charging companies with violating Section 5 for unreasonable
reasonable data-security practices. See pp.7-8 and notes 4 & 5, supra. The
complaints make clear that the failure to take reasonable data-security measures
may constitute an unfair practice, and they flesh out the types of security lapses
that may be deemed unreasonable. The Commission publishes these materials on
45

Case: 14-3514

Document: 003111786127

its website, provides notice in the Federal Register, and solicits and responds to
public comment in order to take into account the views of relevant stakeholders
and ensure that it has complete information on evolving technologies and other
developments.
Given these widely available materials, Wyndham cannot seriously contend
that it lacked notice that its security failures―comparable to those committed by
other companies against which the FTC has taken action―could trigger Section 5
liability. The 2005 complaint in BJ’s Wholesale Club, for example, charged that
the company engaged in unfair acts by “fail[ing] to employ reasonable and
appropriate security measures to protect personal information” because it did not
encrypt data, change default passwords, detect intrusions, or conduct security
investigations. 140 F.T.C. at 467. Wyndham later failed to take those very
precautions. The complaint in DSW, Inc., published later that year, alleged failure
to detect unauthorized access, and failure to use adequate password security. See
http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/2005/12/051201comp05230
96.pdf. The complaint in TJX charged unfair practices for inadequately secure
passwords, inadequate use of firewalls, failure to encrypt data, and failure to install
software security patches. See http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents
/cases/2008/03/080327complaint_0.pdf. The other complaints (see notes 4 & 5,
supra) similarly alleged unreasonable practices premised on similar specific

Case: 14-3514

Document: 003111786127

failures, many of which parallel Wyndham’s lapses. The district court was correct
when it held that these complaints “constitute a body of experience and informed
judgment” to which companies holding private data “may properly resort for
guidance.” Opinion at 24 (JA25).
Wyndham erroneously argues that “the complaints fail to spell out what
specific cybersecurity practices … actually triggered the alleged violation.”
Br. 42. In fact, as the BJ’s example illustrates, the complaints specify the alleged
unreasonable practices in some detail.16 Each complaint gives the business
community further information about the types of security lapses that can trigger
Section 5 liability. And Wyndham committed virtually every security lapse
described in the prior complaints. It cannot now claim that it did not know what
was expected of it.
Wyndham gains nothing by contending that these materials do not specify
exactly “what firewall configurations,” “encryption techniques,” or “password
requirements” companies should adopt as reasonable measures to protect
consumers against evolving threats. Br. 37. Wyndham is not charged with using
12-character passwords when it could have used 13-character ones. Its lapses are
16

Of the nine FTC data-security judgments issued before Wyndham’s first
data breach, see notes 4 & 5, supra, five of them—BJ’s, DSW, CardSystems, TJX,
and Reed Elsevier—involved “unfair practices” claims. Although the other four
involved claims of “deceptive practices” or other statutory violations, a core
allegation in each case was that specific data-security failures were unreasonable.
47

Case: 14-3514

Document: 003111786127

much more basic, akin to using “password” as the password. Among them:
Wyndham used no firewalls at critical points in its network; it did not encrypt
credit card data on property management servers; and it failed to change
manufacturer default passwords. See, e.g., Cmplt. ¶24(f) (JA66-67) (“For
example, to allow remote access to a hotel’s property management system, which
was developed by software developer Micros Systems, Inc., Defendants used the
phrase ‘micros’ as both the user ID and the password[.]”). Wyndham cannot
complain that it lacked specific guidance on the fine details of implementing basic
precautions that it failed to take at all.
Finally, Wyndham argues that prior complaints against other companies
“do[] not and cannot provide fair notice” when they are resolved by consent
judgments because such dispositions do not “adjudicate the legality of any action.”
Br. 41. That is beside the point. The issue here is not whether Wyndham violated
consent decrees entered by other companies. Rather, the pertinent question is
whether, as Wyndham alleges, the FTC provided insufficient guidance as to what
data-security measures companies should undertake. The Commission’s
complaints and consent judgments provide considerable guidance on the types of
gaps in corporate data-security programs that are likely to result in consumer harm
and FTC enforcement action. Moreover, these are precisely the type of
administrative materials that, as the Supreme Court has recognized, parties may

“properly resort to for guidance.” Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 142

The 2007 Business Guide Identified The Basic Data-Security
Obligations That Wyndham Failed To Satisfy

In addition to the complaints against specific company practices, Wyndham
also had notice through the Commission’s efforts to educate the business
community about data-security practices. In 2007, before the first infiltration of
Wyndham’s network, the FTC issued the “Guide for Business” on “Protecting
Personal Information,” which provided a catalogue of reasonable data-security
practices. See pp.5-6, supra.
The Guide specifically cautioned companies against nearly all of the basic
data-security lapses that Wyndham later committed. First, it emphasized the
importance of “[i]dentify[ing] the computers or servers where sensitive personal
information is stored” and “all connections to the computers where you store
sensitive information.” Business Guide 9. Wyndham did not take those steps,
which facilitated the infiltration of its network. Cmplt. ¶24(a), (g), & (j) (JA6667). The Guide advised companies to “consider encrypting sensitive information
that is stored on your computer network.” Business Guide 10. Wyndham did not
encrypt its customers’ credit card information, which enabled thieves to use it more
easily once they stole it. Cmplt. ¶24(b) (JA65). The Guide warned that “[w]hen
installing new software, immediately change vendor supplied default passwords to
49

Case: 14-3514

Document: 003111786127

a more secure strong password.” Business Guide 13. Wyndham allowed
computers on its network to use default passwords, leaving the network more
vulnerable to intrusion. Cmplt. ¶24(e) & (f) (JA66-67). The Guide recommended
that companies “implement policies for installing vendor-approved patches to
correct [security] problems.” Business Guide 10. Property management systems
controlled by Wyndham used out-of-date software that could not receive security
patches, again leaving its system undefended. Cmplt. ¶24(d) (JA66).
The Business Guide further advised that computer networks “[u]se a firewall
to protect your computer from hacker attacks while it is connected to the Internet,”
and, where “some computers on your network store sensitive information while
others do not, consider using additional firewalls to protect the computers with
sensitive information.” Business Guide 15. Wyndham did not use firewalls at
critical points in its network, so once hackers gained access to one network
computer, they could steal customer data from others. Cmplt. ¶24(a) (JA65).
Finally, the Guide suggested that in the event of a security breach, a company
should “consider using an intrusion detection system,” Business Guide 15, and
should “[k]eep an eye out for activity from new users, multiple log-in attempts
from unknown users or computers,” id. at 16. Wyndham ignored that advice too,
also to its customers’ detriment. Cmplt. ¶24(h)-(j) (JA67).

In short, well before the breaches that resulted in the theft of Wyndham’s
customer data, the FTC had provided considerable guidance on the elements of
commercially reasonable data-security measures. The Business Guide provided
guidance on virtually every security lapse that Wyndham subsequently committed.
Wyndham asserts that the Guide “contains little specific guidance on any
particular cybersecurity practices.” Br. 43. As discussed, however, the Business
Guide, though short, contains quite specific guidance on data-security practices.
Wyndham ignores that guidance in its brief, just as it did in running its computer
operations. Of course, the Guide did not specify exactly what exact types of
firewalls, encryption algorithms, intrusion-detection systems, or password
protocols companies should use to meet evolving security threats. But that fact
cannot help Wyndham, which clearly had notice that any prudent company must
implement at least some firewall protection at critical network points, some
encryption of sensitive data, some intrusion-detection systems, and some
reasonably protective password requirements.
Finally, Wyndham objects that the Business Guide provided inadequate
notice that failure to implement such basic data-security safeguards could subject a
company to Section 5 liability. That objection makes little sense, both because the
Guide warns explicitly that “the Federal Trade Commission Act may require you
to provide reasonable security” of the types described within, Business Guide 5,

and, more fundamentally, because the Commission had already based liability in
BJ’s and other unfair-practices cases on failure to implement such safeguards.17

WYNDHAM’S CHALLENGE TO THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE FACTUAL
PLEADINGS LACKS MERIT
As discussed, a company is liable under Section 5 for unfair acts or practices

that, inter alia, cause “substantial injury” that is “not reasonably avoidable by
consumers themselves.” 15 U.S.C. § 45(n).18 Wyndham contends that the
complaint “fails to plead any facts” that satisfy those two statutory criteria. Br. 46.
That challenge is meritless.
A complaint need not contain “detailed factual allegations” to meet the
applicable pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). Rather, the
complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim
to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)
(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). A claim is plausible “when the plaintiff
17

Wyndham argued below that due process requires the Commission to
promulgate rules before it may undertake enforcement actions. Wyndham
abandons that argument now. Br. 39. The argument is meritless anyway for the
reasons the FTC explained below and the district court adopted. Opinion 18-22
(JA19-23). See SEC v. Chenery, 332 U.S. 194, 202-203 (1947); Voegele, 625 F.2d
1075.
18

Section 5(n) also specifies that there be no “countervailing benefits to
consumers or competition” sufficient to outweigh a practice’s harmful effects.
Wyndham does not challenge the sufficiency of the complaint’s allegations
concerning that criterion.

pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that
the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 550 U.S. at 678.
The complaint here amply meets that standard. It alleges the following
facts: Wyndham’s failure to implement reasonable and appropriate security
measures led to three distinct data breaches that compromised more than 619,000
credit and debit card numbers. See Cmplt. ¶40 (JA72-73). The hackers exported
that confidential information to Russia and enabled its use to place more than $10
million in fraudulent charges on the accounts of Wyndham’s customers. Id.
Consumers consequently suffered several distinct injuries, including
“unreimbursed fraudulent charges, increased costs, and lost access to funds or
credit” and “expend[iture of] time and money resolving fraudulent charges and
mitigating subsequent harm.” Id. The complaint thus pleads several distinct and
unavoidable consumer harms, each of which independently meets the
Commission’s pleading burden.
A.

The Allegation That Customers Incurred Unreimbursed Charges
And Credit Problems Meets Applicable Pleading Requirements

By itself, the factual allegation that consumers faced “unreimbursed
charges” is sufficient to sustain the complaint. With more than 600,000 accounts
compromised and more than $10 million in fraudulent charges, it is a fair inference
that even small amounts of unreimbursed charges aggregate to substantial
collective harm.

Wyndham asserts that, as a general matter, credit card issuers make a
practice of reimbursing consumers for any fraudulent charges and that its
customers therefore have suffered no harm. Br. at 48 & n.7, 50. In other words,
Wyndham asserts that the FTC’s facts do not show substantial harm to consumers
because other alleged facts, outside the four corners of the complaint, show that
there was no such harm. That, however, is not a failure of pleading, but a factual
question on the merits. In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court does not “go
beyond facts alleged in the Complaint.” In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig.,
114 F.3d 1410, 1424–1425 (3d Cir. 1997). Thus, at this point in the case, the
Court “must accept[] as true” the FTC’s alleged facts, and it must “draw[]
reasonable inferences in favor of the FTC, not [Wyndham].” Opinion 27-28 (JA
28-29) (citing Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, and Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d
224, 233-234 (3d Cir. 2008)).19
Wyndham’s entire challenge to the sufficiency of the complaint fails for that
reason alone. In any event, that challenge would fail even if it were appropriate to

19

Wyndham also asserts that “[f]ederal law … generally caps consumer
liability for credit or debit card fraud at $50.” Br. 48. Even if the Court could take
judicial notice of what federal law “generally” provides, $50 is not a de minimis
loss even for an individual consumer. Particularly when aggregated, $50 perconsumer losses easily satisfy the statutory requirement of “substantial injury,” 15
U.S.C. § 45(n), a standard that contains no minimum dollar threshold. See
American Financial, 767 F.2d at 972 (“An injury may be sufficiently substantial
… if it does a small harm to a large number of people[.]”).

examine extrinsic facts at this stage. Merely because card issuers allegedly
promised to give their customers refunds to cover all fraud losses does not mean
that they actually did so. For example, some customers might not have detected
the fraudulent charges; even if they detected the charges, they might not have
undertaken the effort and expense of seeking a refund; and even if they asked, such
refunds might not have been forthcoming.
That is why the Commission and the courts have long rejected the
proposition that a “guarantee of … [a] refund prevents injury to the public” and
immunizes perpetrators of unfair or deceptive practices from liability. In re
Michigan Bulb Co., 54 F.T.C. 1329, 1370 (1958) (citing Capon Springs Mineral
Water, Inc. v. FTC, 107 F.2d 516, 519 (3d Cir. 1939)). “[A] money-back guaranty
does not sanitize a fraud.” FTC v. Think Achievement Corp., 312 F.3d 259, 262
(7th Cir. 2002) (Posner, J.). Thus, a practice that causes consumers to incur
unauthorized or fraudulent charges may violate Section 5 even if the perpetrator
offers full refunds to dissatisfied consumers because “many consumers would not
bother to seek” such a refund, especially if the amount is relatively small and the
process of “obtaining a refund [is not] costless.” Id. at 261 (citing Montgomery
Ward & Co. v. FTC, 379 F.2d 666, 671 (7th Cir. 1967); FTC v. Pantron I Corp.,
33 F.3d 1088, 1103 (9th Cir. 1994); and FTC v. SlimAmerica, Inc., 77 F. Supp. 2d
1263, 1273 (S.D. Fla. 1999)).

Wyndham asserts that to the (factually uncertain) extent consumers failed to
take advantage of an offered reimbursement because they “neglected to review
their statements and paid the fraudulent charges without questioning them,” that is
“a ‘reasonably avoidable’ injury” under Section 5(n). Br. 49. This argument, too,
is unavailing. Wyndham does not argue that consumers could have avoided
fraudulent bills in the first place. Consumers are powerless to prevent identity
thieves from accessing and misusing their personal data when the business to
which they entrust their information fails to secure it properly. Wyndham claims
instead that even though its improper practices caused some consumers to pay
fraudulent charges, Wyndham should be unaccountable because those consumers
theoretically could have avoided paying the charges.
As the district court held, the question whether all consumers could avoid all
charges is a “fact-dependent” one not suitable for disposition on a motion to
dismiss. Opinion 32 (JA33). Moreover, Wyndham’s argument sweeps too
broadly. It asks that the Court allow Wyndham “to blame unsuspecting consumers
for failing to detect and dispute unauthorized billing activity.” FTC v. Inc21.com
Corp., 745 F.Supp.2d 975, 1004 (N.D. Cal. 2010), aff’d, 745 Fed.Appx. 106 (9th
Cir. 2012). But “the burden should not be placed on defrauded customers to avoid
charges that were never authorized to begin with.” Id.

It is also immaterial that “the complaint fails to identify any [individual]
consumer who suffered any financial injury.” Br. 46 (emphasis omitted); see also
id. 49-50. The complaint alleges that hundreds of thousands of credit card
accounts were compromised and that at least some consumers suffered
unreimbursed charges. Those facts are sufficient to state a plausible case of
substantial consumer harm. Moreover, the FTC “need not identify specific
victims” in statutory enforcement cases because, in many such cases, “the nature of
the harm is so diffuse that the specific identities of the victims would be nearly
impossible to ascertain.” FTC v. Bronson Partners LLC, 654 F.3d 359, 373 (2d
Cir. 2011). Relief is available even when it is “impossible or impracticable to
locate and reimburse … individual consumers.” Pantron I Corp., 33 F.3d at 1103
n.34.
Finally, the complaint separately alleges that, in addition to unreimbursed
charges, consumers unavoidably “lost access to funds or credit” as a result of
fraudulent charges placed on their accounts. Cmplt. ¶40 (JA73). Given the
number of accounts breached, that allegation independently constitutes a
substantial injury and by itself suffices to sustain the complaint. Wyndham offers
no contrary argument.

The Allegation That Customers Spent Time And Money
Mitigating Harm Independently Meets Applicable Pleading
Requirements

Quite apart from the allegations that the data breaches caused consumers
unreimbursed charges, loss of access to funds, and credit problems, the complaint
also alleges that customers spent “time and money resolving fraudulent charges
and mitigating subsequent harm.” Cmplt. ¶40 (JA73). That allegation, too, is
independently sufficient to meet applicable pleading standards.
Because consumers entrusted their account data to Wyndham and could not
protect it by themselves, they could not avoid the time and effort necessary to undo
the damage of these data breaches and restore their credit, nor could they avoid the
direct and opportunity costs of that wasted time. For example, they had to spend
untold hours on the phone with their credit-card companies; find alternative
sources of credit (if possible) while their accounts were on hold and before new
cards were issued; and risk account suspensions with merchants who had used the
voided cards for automatic renewals. Wyndham does not deny that the complaint
alleges these and similar consumer harms, all of which resulted from Wyndham’s
negligence. Instead, Wyndham relies on Reilly v. Ceridian Corp., 664 F.3d 38 (3d
Cir. 2011), for the proposition that “efforts to redress … exposure” of credit card
data do not state a claim of substantial injury as a matter of law. Br. 47. But Reilly
is inapposite for two basic reasons.
58

First, after the hacker in Reilly breached the firewall of a payroll processor’s
computer system, it was “not known whether the hacker read, copied, or
understood the data” to which it potentially gained access. Reilly, 664 F.3d at 40.
There was thus “no evidence that the intrusion was intentional or malicious,” and
“no identifiable taking [of data] occurred; all that is known is that a firewall was
penetrated.” Id. at 44. On those facts, the Court held that a person whose
information was stored in the computer system had suffered no injury sufficient to
confer Article III standing. Rather, the claimed injury depended on “speculation”
that the hacker actually acquired personal data, “intend[ed] to commit future
criminal acts by misusing the information,” and was “able to … mak[e]
unauthorized transactions.” Id. at 42. “Unless and until these conjectures come
true,” the Court held, plaintiff had “not suffered any injury.” Id. Without “misuse
of the information,” there is “no harm.” Id. In those circumstances, plaintiff’s
“alleged time and money expenditures” were speculative byproducts of the
hypothetical harm. Id. at 46.
Wyndham misreads Reilly as holding categorically that consumer efforts to
mitigate the effects of a data breach cannot constitute substantial injury. But Reilly
addresses injury only when there is no claim that data were stolen or misused.
Here, in contrast, the complaint alleges actual theft of data and actual misuse of
that data: data were stolen, exported to Russia, and used to place more than $10
59

million of fraudulent charges on customer accounts. There is nothing speculative
or hypothetical about the harmful use of the stolen data.
In cases of actual misuse, courts have held that the time, expense, and effort
spent by consumers to mitigate injuries constitutes substantial injury under Section
5(n). In Neovi, which involved fraudulent checks, the Ninth Circuit found
substantial injury on the ground that “obtaining reimbursement required a
substantial investment of time, trouble, aggravation, and money. … Regardless of
whether a bank eventually restored consumers’ money, the consumer suffered
unavoidable injuries that could not be fully mitigated.” Neovi, 604 F.3d at 1158
(internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, in a case involving the unlawful sale
of telephone data, the Tenth Circuit held that “costs in changing telephone
providers” were sufficient harm under Section 5(n). FTC v. Accusearch, Inc., 570
F.3d 1187, 1194 (10th Cir. 2009).
Second, Reilly is inapplicable for the independent reason that it concerned
the standing of private plaintiffs under Article III, not the ability of a federal
agency to bring an action to enforce a consumer-protection statute. Congress has
charged the Commission with enforcing the FTC Act and empowered it to bring
suit to do so. 15 U.S.C. § 53(b). Whereas a private plaintiff must show that injury
is “actual or imminent” and “affect[s] [him or her] in a personal and individual
way,” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 & n.1 (1992), the FTC

need show only that Wyndham’s practices “cause or are likely to cause” injury to
any class of consumers. 15 U.S.C. § 45(n) (emphasis added); see also SEC v.
Rana Research, Inc., 8 F.3d 1358, 1363-1364 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding that under
the securities antifraud laws, the government need not prove investor reliance or
loss causation in enforcement actions). Here, whether or not an individual plaintiff
could show particularized injury sufficient to satisfy Article III, the export of
consumer credit card information to Russia is likely to cause injury simply because
the information is in the hands of people who can use it—and have used it—to
commit fraud.
CONCLUSION
The district court’s decision should be affirmed.

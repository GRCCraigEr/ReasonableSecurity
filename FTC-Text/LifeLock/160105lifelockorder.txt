FINDINGS
1.

This Court entered the Permanent Injunction enjoining LifeLock from, inter

26

alia, “misrepresenting in any manner, expressly or by implication, the means, methods,

27

procedures, effects, effectiveness, coverage, or scope” of its identity theft protection

28

service (Section I.A.5);

Case 2:10-cv-00530-JJT Document 67 Filed 01/04/16 Page 2 of 12

1

2.

The Permanent Injunction enjoins LifeLock from “misrepresenting in any

2

manner, expressly or by implication, the manner or extent to which they maintain and

3

protect the privacy, confidentiality, or security of any personal information collected

4

from or about consumers” (Section I.B.);

5
6

3.

The Permanent Injunction requires LifeLock to “establish and implement,

and thereafter maintain, a comprehensive information security program” (Section II);

7

4.

The Permanent Injunction further requires LifeLock to create and retain

8

“[a]ll records and documents necessary to determine full compliance with each

9

provision” of the Permanent Injunction (Section VIII.A.7);

10

5.

On July 21, 2015, the Commission alleged that LifeLock violated the

11

Permanent Injunction by:

12

information security program to protect its users’ sensitive personal data, including credit

13

card, social security, and bank account numbers; (b) falsely advertising that it protected

14

consumers’ sensitive data with the same high-level safeguards as financial institutions;

15

(c) failing to meet the Permanent Injunction’s recordkeeping requirements; and (d)

16

falsely claiming it protected consumers’ identity 24/7/365 by providing alerts “as soon

17

as” it received any indication there was a problem;

18
19
20

(a) failing to establish and maintain a comprehensive

6.

LifeLock neither admits nor denies the allegations identified in Paragraph 5

7.

These findings constitute an appropriate change in circumstances to warrant

above;

21

modifying Sections VI through IX of the Permanent Injunction pursuant to Rule 60(b) of

22

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and

23
24

8.

The parties have agreed to settle the Commission’s allegations with the

entry of this Order.

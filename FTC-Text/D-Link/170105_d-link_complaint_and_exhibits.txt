92708. DLS transacts or has transacted business in this district and throughout the United States.

2

At all times material to this Complaint, acting alone or in concert with others, DLS has

3

advertised, marketed, distributed, or sold routers, IP cameras, and related software and services,

4

intended for use by consumers throughout the United States. The Chairman of DLS’s Board of

5

Directors has served as D-Link’s Chief Executive Officer and the two entities have coordinated

6

closely regarding the security of Defendants’ routers and IP cameras.

7
8

8.

The FTC’s claims against D-Link and DLS arise from or relate to Defendants’

acts or practices aimed at or taking place in the United States.

9
10

COMMERCE
9.

At all times material to this Complaint, Defendants have maintained a substantial

11

course of trade in or affecting commerce, as “commerce” is defined in Section 4 of the FTC Act,

12

15 U.S.C. § 44.

13
14

DEFENDANTS’ BUSINESS PRACTICES
10.

D-Link is a hardware device manufacturer that designs, develops, markets, and

15

manufactures networking devices, including devices with core functions that relate to security,

16

such as consumer routers and IP cameras. D-Link designs, develops, and manufactures these

17

products, their marketing materials, and related software and services for distribution or sale to

18

United States consumers through its subsidiary, DLS.

19
20
21

When releasing new software for such

22

routers and IP cameras, D-Link uses a digital signature issued in its name, known as a “private

23

key,” to sign the software, in order to assure entities, such as browsers and operating systems,

24

that the software comes from an authentic or “trusted” source and is not malware.

25

11.

DLS is a subsidiary of D-Link and is nearly 98% owned by D-Link and its

26

holding company, D-Link Holding Company, Ltd. DLS provides marketing and after-sale

27

services integral to D-Link’s operations, including by marketing and acting as the sole

distributor of Defendants’ routers and IP cameras throughout the United States.

2
3

Among other services, DLS acts as the primary point-of-contact for

4

problems that United States consumers have with Defendants’ routers, IP cameras, or related

5

software and services;

6
7

DLS also assists in notifying

8

United States consumers about the availability of security updates through means such as

9

DLS’s websites.

10

12.

Defendants have provided software applications that enable users to access their

11

routers and IP cameras from a mobile device (“mobile apps”), including a free “mydlink Lite”

12

mobile app. Defendants designed the mydlink Lite app to require the user to enter a user name

13

and password (“login credentials”) the first occasion that a user employs the app on a particular

14

mobile device. After that first occasion, the app stores the user’s login credentials on that

15

mobile device, keeping the user logged into the mobile app on that device.

16
17

DEFENDANTS’ ROUTERS
13.

Defendants’ routers, like other routers, operate to forward data packets along a

18

network. In addition to routing network traffic, they typically play a key role in securing

19

consumers’ home networks, functioning as a hardware firewall for the local network, and

20

acting as the first line of defense in protecting consumer devices on the local network, such as

21

computers, smartphones, IP cameras, and other connected appliances, against malicious

22

incoming traffic from the Internet.

23
24

DEFENDANTS’ IP CAMERAS
14.

Defendants’ IP cameras, akin to many such IP cameras, play a key security role

25

for consumers, by enabling consumers to monitor private areas of their homes or businesses, to

26

detect any events that may place the property or its occupants at risk. In many instances,

27

Defendants offer them as a means to monitor the security of a home while consumers are away,

or to monitor activities within the household, including the activities of young children, while a

2

consumer is at home. Consumers seeking to monitor the security of their homes or the safety

3

of young children may access live video and audio feeds (“live feeds”) from their cameras over

4

the Internet, using a mobile device or other computer.

5
6

DEFENDANTS’ SECURITY FAILURES
15.

Defendants have failed to take reasonable steps to protect their routers and IP

7

cameras from widely known and reasonably foreseeable risks of unauthorized access, including

8

by failing to protect against flaws which the Open Web Application Security Project has ranked

9

among the most critical and widespread web application vulnerabilities since at least 2007.

10

Among other things:

11

a. Defendants repeatedly have failed to take reasonable software testing and

12

remediation measures to protect their routers and IP cameras against well-

13

known and easily preventable software security flaws, such as “hard-coded”

14

user credentials and other backdoors, and command injection flaws, which

15

would allow remote attackers to gain control of consumers’ devices;

16

b. Defendant D-Link has failed to take reasonable steps to maintain the

17

confidentiality of the private key that Defendant D-Link used to sign

18

Defendants’ software, including by failing to adequately restrict, monitor, and

19

oversee handling of the key, resulting in the exposure of the private key on a

20

public website for approximately six months; and

21

c. Defendants have failed to use free software, available since at least 2008, to

22

secure users’ mobile app login credentials, and instead have stored those

23

credentials in clear, readable text on a user’s mobile device.

24

THOUSANDS OF CONSUMERS AT RISK

25

16.

As a result of Defendants’ failures, thousands of Defendants’ routers and

26

cameras have been vulnerable to attacks that subject consumers’ sensitive personal

27

information and local networks to a significant risk of unauthorized access. In fact, the press

28

COMPLAINT

PAGE 5

Case 3:17-cv-00039 Document 1 Filed 01/05/17 Page 6 of 14

1

has reported that Defendants’ routers and cameras have been vulnerable to a range of such

2

attacks and have been compromised by attackers, including by being made part of large scale

3

networks of computers infected by malicious software, known as “botnets.”

4

17.

The risk that attackers would exploit these vulnerabilities to harm consumers was

5

significant. In many instances, remote attackers could take simple steps, using widely available

6

tools, to locate and exploit Defendants’ devices, which were widely known to be vulnerable. For

7

example, remote attackers could search for vulnerable devices over the Internet and obtain their

8

IP addresses using readily available tools, such as a popular search engine that can locate devices

9

running particular software versions or operating in particular locations. Alternatively, attackers

10

could use readily accessible scanning tools to identify vulnerable devices operating in particular

11

areas or on particular networks. In many instances, an attacker could then take simple steps to

12

exploit vulnerabilities in Defendants’ routers and IP cameras, impacting not only consumers who

13

purchased these devices, but also other consumers, who access the Internet in public or private

14

locations served by the routers or who visit locations under the IP cameras’ surveillance.

15

18.

By creating these vulnerabilities, Defendants put consumers at significant risk of

16

harm in a variety of ways. An attacker could compromise a consumer’s router, thereby obtaining

17

unauthorized access to consumers’ sensitive personal information. For example, using a

18

compromised router, an attacker could re-direct consumers seeking a legitimate financial site to a

19

spoofed website, where they would unwittingly provide the attacker with sensitive financial

20

account information. Alternatively, using a compromised router, an attacker could obtain

21

consumers’ tax returns or other files stored on the router’s attached storage device or could use

22

the router to attack other devices on the local network, such as computers, smartphones, IP

23

cameras, or connected appliances. Similarly, by exploiting the vulnerabilities described in

24

Paragraph 15, an attacker could compromise a consumer’s IP camera, thereby monitoring

25

consumers’ whereabouts to target them for theft or other criminal activity or to observe and

26

record over the Internet their personal activities and conversations or those of their young

27

children. In many instances, attackers could carry out such exploits covertly, such that

1

consumers would have no reason to know that an attack was ongoing. Finally, during the time

2

Defendant D-Link’s private key was available on a public website, consumers seeking to

3

download legitimate software from Defendants were at significant risk of downloading malware,

4

signed by malicious actors using D-Link’s private key.

5
6
7

DEFENDANTS’ SECURITY STATEMENTS
19.

Defendants have disseminated or caused to be disseminated to consumers

statements regarding the security of their products, including their routers and IP cameras.

8
9

SECURITY EVENT RESPONSE POLICY
20.

From approximately December 2013 until early September 2015, after highly-

10

publicized security flaws were found to affect many of its products, Defendant DLS posted a

11

Security Event Response Policy on its product support webpage,

12

http://support.dlink.com/securityadvisories.aspx, in the general form of Exhibit 1. Within

13

its Security Event Response Policy, under a bolded heading “D-Link’s commitment to Product

14

Security,” Defendant DLS stated:

15

D-Link prohibits at all times, including during product development by D-Link or its

16

affiliates, any intentional product features or behaviors which allow unauthorized access

17

to the device or network, including but not limited to undocumented account

18

credentials, covert communication channels, ‘backdoors’ or undocumented traffic

19

diversion. All such features and behaviors are considered serious and will be given the

20

highest priority.

21
22

PROMOTIONAL CLAIMS
21.

Defendants highlight their routers’ security features in a wide range of materials

23

available on Defendant DLS’s website, including user manuals and promotional brochures,

24

which describe these features alongside language that specifically references the device’s

25

“security”. Such materials include, but are not limited to, brochures in the general form of

Acts or practices are unfair under Section 5 of the FTC Act if they cause or are

2

likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that consumers cannot reasonably avoid

3

themselves and that is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. 15

U.S.C. § 45(n).

5

COUNT I

6

Unfairness

7

28.

In numerous instances, Defendants have failed to take reasonable steps to secure

8

the software for their routers and IP cameras, which Defendants offered to consumers,

9

respectively, for the purpose of protecting their local networks and accessing sensitive personal

10

information.

11

29.

Defendants’ practices caused, or are likely to cause, substantial injury to

12

consumers in the United States that is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or

13

competition and is not reasonably avoidable by consumers.

14

30.

Therefore, Defendants’ acts and practices as described in Paragraphs 15-18 of this

15

Complaint constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce, in violation of Section 5

16

Get Ready for the Future - 1Pv6 Equ ipped
With the growing number of Internet-enabled applications
requiring IP addresses, the supply of IP addresses under the
current Internet Protocol version 4 (1Pv4) system has already been
exhausted. The 1Pv6 protocol solves this network addressing
exhaustion by creating more IP addresses, but migration from
1Pv4 to 1Pv6 is not necessarily automatic. No worries - This D-Link
produd is 1Pv6 Certified and ready for the future.

AGREEMENT CONTAINING
CONSENT ORDER

FILE NO. 132 3089

The Federal Trade Commission (“Commission”) has conducted an investigation of
certain acts and practices of Fandango, LLC (“Fandango” or “proposed respondent”). Proposed
respondent, having been represented by counsel, is willing to enter into an agreement containing
a consent order resolving the allegations contained in the attached draft complaint. Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY AGREED by and between Fandango, LLC, by its duly authorized
officers, and counsel for the Federal Trade Commission that:
1.

Proposed respondent Fandango, LLC (“Fandango”) is a Delaware limited liability
company with its principal office or place of business at 12200 W. Olympic Boulevard,
Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA 90064.

2.

Proposed respondent admits all jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft complaint.

3.

Proposed respondent waives:

4.

A.

any further procedural steps;

B.

the requirement that the Commission’s decision contain a statement of findings of
fact and conclusions of law; and

C.

all rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity
of the order entered pursuant to this agreement.

This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and
until it is accepted by the Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission,
it, together with the draft complaint, will be placed on the public record for a period of
thirty (30) days and information about it publicly released. The Commission thereafter
may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify proposed respondent,
in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve
its complaint (in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision in disposition
of the proceeding.
1

5.

This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by
proposed respondent that the law has been violated as alleged in the draft complaint, or
the facts as alleged in the draft complaint, other than the jurisdictional facts, are true.

6.

This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such
acceptance is not subsequently withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2.34 of the Commission’s Rules, the Commission may, without further notice
to proposed respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with
the attached draft complaint and its decision containing the following order in disposition
of the proceeding, and (2) make information about it public. When so entered, the order
shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the
same manner and within the same time provided by statute for other orders. The order
shall become final upon service. Delivery of the complaint and the decision and order to
proposed respondent’s address as stated in this agreement by any means specified in
Section 4.4(a) of the Commission’s Rules shall constitute service. Proposed respondent
waives any right it may have to any other manner of service. The complaint may be used
in construing the terms of the order. No agreement, understanding, representation, or
interpretation not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or
contradict the terms of the order.

7.

Proposed respondent has read the draft complaint and consent order. Proposed
respondent understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided by
law and other appropriate relief for each violation of the order after it becomes final.

material impact on the effectiveness of its security program.
III.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, in connection with its compliance with Part II of this

effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance that the security, confidentiality,
and integrity of covered information is protected and has so operated
throughout the reporting period.

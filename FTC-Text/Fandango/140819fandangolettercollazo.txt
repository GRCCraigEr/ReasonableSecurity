Re:

In the Matter of Fandango LLC., File No. 132 3089, Docket No. C-4481

Dear Ms. Collazo:
Thank you for your comment regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s proposed
consent agreement in the above-entitled proceeding. Your comment indicates that you were
unaware of Fandango, LLC’s security failures, and are now concerned about the security of your
personal information.
The Commission understands that security is very important to you. The proposed
consent order requires Fandango, LLC to implement a comprehensive security program and to
obtain a biennial assessment from an independent third party for the duration of the 20-year
order, among other things. These requirements will help ensure that your personal information is
protected in the future.
We appreciate your support for the FTC’s proposed consent order. The Commission has
placed your comment on the public record pursuant to rule 4.9(b)(6)(ii) of the Commission’s
Rules of Practice, 16 C.F.R. §4.9(b)(6)(ii). The Commission has now determined that the public
interest would best be served by issuing the Complaint and the Decision and Order in final form
without any modifications. The final Decision and Order and other relevant materials are
available from the Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov. The Commission thanks you
again for your comment.
By direction of the Commission, Commissioner McSweeny not participating.

Donald S. Clark
Secretary

Re:

Guidance Software, Inc.
Matter No. 0623057

Dear Mr. Berry:
This acknowledges your letter commenting on the Federal Trade Commission’s consent
agreement in the above-entitled proceeding. Your letter was placed on the public record pursuant
to Rule 4.9(b)(6)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 16 C.F.R. § 4.9(b)(6)(ii), and was
given serious consideration by the Commission.
Your comment states that the proposed consent order should require Guidance Software,
Inc. (“the respondent”) to protect copyrighted programs on its computer networks from
unauthorized access, and to provide copies of assessments required under the order to the owners
of copyrighted programs. In response, the Commission notes that the complaint in this matter
alleges failure to secure information obtained from customers’ credit cards, and does not allege
that the respondent failed to secure copyrighted programs. Accordingly, the order requires the
respondent to take reasonable measures to secure personal information it collects from or about
consumers. Finally, because security assessments could reveal information that could facilitate
unauthorized access to the respondent’s computer systems, providing assessments to owners of
copyrighted programs could put sensitive information at risk.
After reviewing your comment, the Commission has determined that the public interest
would be best served by accepting the consent order. Thank you again for your comment.
By direction of the Commission.

Donald S. Clark
Secretary

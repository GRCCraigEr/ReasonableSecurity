DEFENDANTS’ BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
10.

Ruby is a privately-held holding company for various wholly-owned subsidiaries,

including Ruby Life and ADL Media (collectively, “Defendants”) that together operate a number
of dating websites including AshleyMadison.com, CougarLife.com, EstablishedMen.com, and
ManCrunch.com.
11.

Created in 2002, Defendants’ most profitable website is AshleyMadison.com,

which is an online dating website for married individuals or people in committed relationships
interested in having affairs with other adults. In 2015, Defendants earned an estimated $47.4
million in U.S. revenue from AshleyMadison.com.

3

Case 1:16-cv-02438 Document 1 Filed 12/14/16 Page 4 of 16

12.

While AshleyMadison.com has members from over 46 countries, the majority of

the website’s members reside in the United States. Since 2002, 18,981,464 people from the
United States have created profiles on AshleyMadison.com. 15,790,849 of those profiles were
male. 3,190,615 were female.
THE ASHLEY MADISON WEBSITE
13.

On AshleyMadison.com, consumers establish dating profiles by entering their

email address and providing information about themselves in the form of free-form text,
selections from menus, and photographs. Defendants do not verify the email addresses
consumers use to sign up for AshleyMadison.com.
14.

Once consumers create their profiles on AshleyMadison.com, they can engage in

a number of activities for free. For example, they can perform searches, receive communications
known as “winks,” and display and view photographs, among other things.
15.

Consumers can engage in other activities on AshleyMadison.com only by paying

money and upgrading to “full membership.” Among other things, full members can send
messages, initiate online real-time chats, or send virtual gifts. Other activities, which are not
included in full membership, require subscriptions that consumers pay on a monthly basis. For
example, “Priority Man” highlights the profiles of male members and elevates their profiles to a
top position in search results. Over 1.4 million U.S. consumers paid for services from 2002
through 2015.
16.

As part of their service, Defendants collect, maintain, and transmit a host of

personal information including: full name; username; gender; address, including zip codes;
relationship status; date of birth; ethnicity; height; weight; email address; sexual preferences and

4

Case 1:16-cv-02438 Document 1 Filed 12/14/16 Page 5 of 16

desired encounters; desired activities; photographs; payment card numbers; hashed passwords;
answers to security questions; and travel locations and dates. Defendants also collect and
maintain consumers’ communications with each other, such as messages and chats.
DEFENDANTS’ USE OF ENGAGER PROFILES
TO COMMUNICATE WITH CONSUMERS
17.

When consumers sign up on AshleyMadison.com, the welcome message states

that they “have thousands of women in [the consumer’s] city who are in the exact same situation
as [the consumer] and looking to have a discreet affair.”

18.

Until August 2014, Defendants engaged in a practice of using “engager

profiles”—that is, fake profiles created by Defendants’ staff who communicate with consumers
in the same way that consumers would communicate with each other—as a way to engage or
attract additional consumers to AshleyMadison.com. In 2014, there were 28,417 engager
profiles on the website. All but 3 of the engager profiles were female.
19.

Defendants created these profiles using profile information, including

photographs, from existing members who had not had any account activity within the preceding
one or more years.
20.

Until August 2014, when U.S. consumers clicked on the “Start Finding Women
5

Case 1:16-cv-02438 Document 1 Filed 12/14/16 Page 6 of 16

Now” link depicted in Paragraph 17, engager profiles appeared in their search results.
Defendants created these engager profiles to interact with consumers by sending winks,
automated replies, and stock messages. Defendants sent these communications to members on
AshleyMadison.com who did not have credits in their accounts.
21.

Because these engager profiles contained the same type of information as

someone who was actually using the website, there was no way for a consumer to determine
whether an engager profile was fake or real. To consumers using AshleyMadison.com, the
communications generated by engager profiles were indistinguishable from communications
generated by actual members.
22.

As a result of Defendants’ use of engager profiles, in many instances until April

2013, consumers without credits in their accounts were induced to upgrade to full memberships
so that they could send emails and engage in online real-time chats with these fake profiles.
DELETION OF CONSUMER PROFILES
23.

When consumers signed up for AshleyMadison.com, Defendants explained that

their system is “100% secure” because consumers can delete their “digital trail.”

24.

If consumers decide they want to delete their profiles on AshleyMadison.com,

they can click on a “Delete Profile” link in their profile settings, which will give them two
options: a “Basic Deactivation” or a “Full Delete” (see Exhibit A).

6

Case 1:16-cv-02438 Document 1 Filed 12/14/16 Page 7 of 16

25.

Basic Deactivation allows consumers to remove their profiles from search results,

but profile information and messages are still accessible to other people with whom consumers
have communicated. Consumers can use the Basic Deactivation option free of charge, and it is
reversible if they decide to return to AshleyMadison.com.
26.

Defendants market the Full Delete option on AshleyMadison.com as a way for

consumers to remove their profiles from the website completely. The Full Delete option states
that it includes removal of: profiles from search results; profiles from the website; messages sent
and received; messages from a recipient’s mailboxes, including winks and virtual gifts; site
usage history; personally identifiable information; and photographs from the site.
27.

Until July 2015, Defendants charged consumers $19 to use the Full Delete option.

This option, along with the accompanying charge, was available to consumers who decided to no
longer engage with the site. From December 2012 through December 2015, 125,714 U.S.
consumers paid a total of $2,388,566 for the Full Delete option.
28.

In many instances, Defendants removed consumer profiles from

AshleyMadison.com within 48 hours of receiving a Full Delete request, but retained personal
information for up to 12 months. In other instances, Defendants failed to remove consumer
profiles from their internal systems.
29.

After purchasing the Full Delete option, for the first time, Defendants notified

consumers that “[s]ome information will be retained for 6-12 months due to legal and financial
reasons after which it will be removed as well.”

DEFENDANTS’ STATEMENTS REGARDING
PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY
30.

Until at least October 2015, Defendants described AshleyMadison.com as secure:
a. on the homepage by prominently displaying an icon of a “Trusted Security
Award,” an icon indicating that the website was an “SSL Secure Site,” and an
image indicating that the website offered “100% Discreet Service”;

b. in statements by Defendants’ executives on AshleyMadison.com that the website
was “100% secure,” “risk free,” and “completely anonymous”;
c. in advertisements describing AshleyMadison.com as “secure,” “anonymous,” and
“risk free” (see Exhibits B–C); and
d. in Defendants’ Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy via a link on the
AshleyMadison.com sign-up page. With respect to the security safeguards, the
Privacy Policy states:
We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
unauthorized access. To safeguard confidentiality and security
of your PII, we use industry standard practices and technologies
including but not limited to “firewalls,” encrypted transmission
via SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and strong data encryption of
sensitive personal and/or financial information when it is stored
to disk.

DEFENDANTS’ FAILURE TO REASONABLY SECURE
THEIR NETWORK AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS
31.

Defendants have engaged in a number of practices that, taken together, failed to

provide reasonable security to prevent unauthorized access to personal information on their
network. Among other things, Defendants have:
a. failed to have a written organizational information security policy;
b. failed to implement reasonable access controls. For example, they:
i.

failed to regularly monitor unsuccessful login attempts;

ii.

failed to secure remote access;

iii.

failed to revoke passwords for ex-employees of their service providers;

iv.

failed to restrict access to systems based on employees’ job functions;

v.

failed to deploy reasonable controls to identify, detect, and prevent the
retention of passwords and encryption keys in clear text files on
Defendants’ network; and

vi.

allowed their employees to reuse passwords to access multiple servers and
services;

c. failed to adequately train Defendants’ personnel to perform their data securityrelated duties and responsibilities;
d. failed to ascertain that third-party service providers implemented reasonable
security measures to protect personal information. For example, Defendants
failed to contractually require service providers to implement reasonable security;
and

9

Case 1:16-cv-02438 Document 1 Filed 12/14/16 Page 10 of 16

e. failed to use readily available security measures to monitor their system and assets
at discrete intervals to identify data security events and verify the effectiveness of
protective measures.
32.

In addition, contrary to Defendants’ statement in Paragraph 30(a), Defendants

never received a “Trusted Security Award” from any organization.
SECURITY INCIDENTS
33.

To gain remote access to Defendants’ corporate network, employees of

Defendants and their service providers needed to use (1) their own unique passwords, and (2) a
second, shared password common to all legitimate users of Defendants’ network. Defendants’
failures described in Paragraph 31 resulted in inadequate security for both of these passwords.
For example, individual passwords and encryption keys were stored as plain text in emails and
text files on Defendants’ network, and a text file containing the “shared password” for access to
the Defendants’ virtual private network (VPN) was available on the Defendants’ Google Drive.
34.

As a result of Defendants’ failures, intruders were able to gain access to these

passwords and log in to the networks of Defendants and their service providers on multiple
occasions in 2014 and 2015. Specifically:
a. On multiple occasions from November 1, 2014, through April 9, 2015, intruders
were able to log into Defendants’ VPN, which was a system used to allow remote
access to Defendants’ corporate network; and
b. On May 17, 2015, and June 9, 2015, there were successful unauthorized logins to
one of AshleyMadison.com’s payment processors using Defendants’ credentials.

10

Case 1:16-cv-02438 Document 1 Filed 12/14/16 Page 11 of 16

35.

Because of Defendants’ failure to monitor their system logs at discrete intervals,

Defendants were unaware that there were unauthorized individuals who had access to employee
and service provider credentials. It was not until after the data breach that Defendants became
aware of these unauthorized logins.
DATA BREACH
36.

On July 12, 2015, Defendants’ employees detected a large file of data being

transferred from one database to another. The next day, a notice appeared on two of Defendants’
customer service computers stating that the company had been hacked and demanding the
immediate shut down of AshleyMadison.com and EstablishedMen.com. The message warned
that if Defendants did not immediately and permanently shut down those websites, the hackers
would release all customer records for the sites, as well as employee documents and email
communications.
37.

On August 18 and 20, 2015, a group identifying itself as “The Impact Team”

published 9.7 gigabytes of information online pertaining to more than 36 million
AshleyMadison.com customers and Defendants themselves. The information included the full
name of paying customers and usernames and email addresses of non-paying customers, in
conjunction with the following categories of information:
a. profile information—including relationship status, gender, date of birth, sexual
preferences and desired encounters, and desired activities;
b. account information—including codes corresponding to security questions,
security answers, and hashed passwords; and

11

Case 1:16-cv-02438 Document 1 Filed 12/14/16 Page 12 of 16

c. billing information for paying customers including billing addresses and the last
four digits of consumers’ credit and debit card numbers. Full credit card numbers
for some consumers were contained in the published data.
38.

Information of consumers who paid for Full Delete was included in the

information that was published online.
39.

Once information was published, a number of websites appeared where people

could determine whether someone was a member of AshleyMadison.com by inputting an email
address.
THE IMPACT OF DEFENDANTS’ FAILURES ON CONSUMERS
40.

Defendants’ failures to provide reasonable security for the sensitive, personal

information they collected, transmitted, and stored, including sexual preferences and desired
encounters, desired activities, email addresses, security questions and answers, real names,
billing addresses, and credit card numbers, has caused or is likely to cause substantial injury to
consumers in the form of extortion, fraud, disclosure of sensitive, personal information, and
other harm.
41.

The security incidents and data breach described in Paragraphs 33–39 exacerbated

the risk of these harms. These incidents led to the creation of websites where people could
determine whether someone was a member of AshleyMadison.com, thereby disclosing
consumers’ highly sensitive, private information. Consumers could not reasonably avoid these
harms.
42.

Defendants could have prevented or mitigated these risks through relatively low-

cost measures.

VIOLATIONS OF THE FTC ACT
43.

Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a), prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts

or practices in or affecting commerce.”
44.

Misrepresentations or deceptive omissions of material fact constitute deceptive

acts or practices prohibited by Section 5(a) of the FTC Act.
45.

Acts or practices are unfair under Section 5 of the FTC Act if they cause

substantial injury to consumers that consumers cannot reasonably avoid themselves and that is
not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. 15 U.S.C. § 45(n).
COUNT I
MISREPRESENTATIONS REGARDING NETWORK SECURITY
46.

As described in Paragraph 30, Defendants have represented, expressly or by

implication, directly or indirectly, that they took reasonable steps to ensure that
AshleyMadison.com was secure.
47.

In truth and in fact, as described in Paragraphs 31–39, Defendants did not take

reasonable steps to ensure that AshleyMadison.com was secure. Therefore, the representation
set forth in Paragraph 46 is false or misleading.
COUNT II
MISREPRESENTATIONS REGARDING USER PROFILES
48.

As described in Paragraphs 17 and 22, until April 2013, Defendants have

represented, expressly or by implication, directly or indirectly, that communications received by
members were from actual women interested in communicating with those members.
49.

In truth and in fact, as described in Paragraph 18, many of the communications

received by members were not from actual women, but instead were from engager profiles

13

Case 1:16-cv-02438 Document 1 Filed 12/14/16 Page 14 of 16

Defendants’ staff created. Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 48 is false or
misleading.
COUNT III
MISREPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR DELETING PROFILES
50.

As described in Paragraphs 23–27, Defendants have represented, expressly or by

implication, directly or indirectly, that they would delete all of the information of consumers who
chose the Full Delete option on AshleyMadison.com.
51.

In truth and in fact, as described in Paragraphs 28–29, even for those consumers

who paid a $19 fee for the Full Delete option, Defendants retained the information from those
profiles for up to 12 months. Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 50 is false or
misleading.
COUNT IV
MISREPRESENTATIONS REGARING DATA SECURITY SEAL
52.

As described in Paragraph 30(a), Defendants have represented, expressly or by

implication, directly or indirectly, that AshleyMadison.com had received a “Trusted Security
Award.”
53.

In truth and in fact, as described in Paragraph 32, Defendants never received a

“Trusted Security Award.” Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 52 is false or
misleading.
COUNT V
UNFAIR SECURITY PRACTICES
54.

As set forth in Paragraph 31, Defendants have failed to take reasonable steps to

prevent unauthorized access to personal information on their network.

14

Case 1:16-cv-02438 Document 1 Filed 12/14/16 Page 15 of 16

55.

Defendants’ actions caused or are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers

that consumers cannot reasonably avoid themselves and that is not outweighed by countervailing
benefits to consumers or competition.
56.

Therefore, Defendants’ practices as described in Paragraph 54 above constitute

unfair acts or practices in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 45(a) and 45(n).
CONSUMER INJURY
57.

Consumers have suffered or are likely to suffer substantial injury as a result of

Defendants’ violations of the FTC Act. In addition, Defendants have been unjustly enriched as a
result of their unlawful acts or practices. Absent injunctive relief by this Court, Defendants are
likely to continue to injure consumers, reap unjust enrichment, and harm the public interest.
THIS COURT’S POWER TO GRANT RELIEF
58.

Section 13(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 53(b), empowers this Court to grant

injunctive and such other relief as the Court may deem appropriate to halt and redress violations
of any provision of law enforced by the FTC. The Court, in the exercise of its equitable
jurisdiction, may award ancillary relief, including rescission or reformation of contracts,
restitution, the refund of monies paid, and the disgorgement of ill-gotten monies, to prevent and
remedy any violation of any provision of law enforced by the FTC.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
59.

Wherefore, the FTC, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 53(b)

and the Court’s own equitable powers, requests that the Court:
a. Enter a permanent injunction to prevent future violations of the FTC Act by
Defendants;

15

Case 1:16-cv-02438 Document 1 Filed 12/14/16 Page 16 of 16

b. Award such relief as the Court finds necessary to redress injury to consumers
resulting from Defendants' violations of the FTC Act, including but not limited
to, restitution, the refund of monies paid, and the disgorgement of ill-gotten
monies; and
c. Award the FTC the costs of bringing this action, as well as such other and
additional relief as the Court may determine to be just and proper.

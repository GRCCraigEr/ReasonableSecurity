AGREEMENT CONTAINING
CONSENT ORDER

FILE NO. 152 3187

The Federal Trade Commission has conducted an investigation of certain acts and
practices of IOActive, Inc. (“proposed respondent”). Proposed respondent is willing to enter into
an agreement containing a consent order resolving the allegations contained in the attached draft
complaint. Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY AGREED by and between IOActive, Inc., by its duly authorized
officers, and counsel for the Federal Trade Commission that:
1.

Proposed respondent IOActive, Inc. is a Washington corporation with its principal office
or place of business at 701 5th Avenue, Suite 6850, Seattle, Washington.

2.

Proposed respondent neither admits nor denies any of the allegations in the draft
complaint, except as specifically stated in this order. Only for purposes of this action,
proposed respondent admits the facts necessary to establish jurisdiction.

3.

Proposed respondent waives:

4.

A.

any further procedural steps;

B.

the requirement that the Commission’s decision contain a statement of findings of
fact and conclusions of law; and

C.

all rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity
of the order entered pursuant to this agreement.

This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and
until it is accepted by the Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission,
it, together with the draft complaint, will be placed on the public record for a period of
Page 1 of 5

thirty (30) days and information about it publicly released. The Commission thereafter
may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify proposed respondent,
in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve
its complaint (in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision in disposition
of the proceeding.
5.

This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such
acceptance is not subsequently withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2.34 of the Commission’s Rules, the Commission may, without further notice
to proposed respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with
the attached draft complaint and its decision containing the following order in disposition
of the proceeding, and (2) make information about it public. When so entered, the order
shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the
same manner and within the same time provided by statute for other orders. The order
shall become final upon service. Delivery of the complaint and the decision and order to
proposed respondent’s address as stated in this agreement by any means specified in
Section 4.4(a) of the Commission’s Rules shall constitute service. Proposed respondent
waives any right it may have to any other manner of service. The complaint may be used
in construing the terms of the order. No agreement, understanding, representation, or
interpretation not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or
contradict the terms of the order.

6.

Proposed respondent has read the draft complaint and consent order. Proposed
respondent understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided by
law and other appropriate relief for each violation of the order after it becomes final.

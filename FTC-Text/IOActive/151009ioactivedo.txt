In the Matter of

DOCKET NO. C-4542
DECISION AND ORDER

The Federal Trade Commission (“Commission” or “FTC”), having initiated an
investigation of certain acts and practices of the respondent named in the caption hereof, and the
respondent having been furnished thereafter with a copy of a draft complaint that the Bureau of
Consumer Protection proposed to present to the Commission for its consideration and which, if
issued by the Commission, would charge respondent with violations of the Federal Trade
Commission Act (“FTC Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 45 et seq.;
The respondent, its attorney, and counsel for the Commission having thereafter executed
an Agreement Containing Consent Order (“Consent Agreement”), which includes: a statement
by respondent that it neither admits nor denies any of the allegations in the draft complaint,
except as specifically stated in the Consent Agreement, and, only for purposes of this action,
admits the facts necessary to establish jurisdiction; and waivers and other provisions as required
by the Commission’s Rules; and
The Commission having thereafter considered the matter and having determined that it
had reason to believe that the respondent violated the FTC Act, and that a complaint should issue
stating its charges in that respect, and having thereupon accepted the executed Consent
Agreement and placed such agreement on the public record for a period of thirty (30) days for
the receipt and consideration of public comments, now in further conformity with the procedure
prescribed by Commission Rule 2.34, 16 C.F.R. § 2.34, the Commission hereby issues its
complaint, makes the following jurisdictional findings, and enters the following Order:
